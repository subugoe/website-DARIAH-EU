One of the 				premises for the design of the digital library of Slovenia (for more on formal support: see Appendix I: Documents) is the Strategy 				of the Republic of Slovenia in the Information Society (si2010). The dLib is classified within the sixth target area of the said 				Strategy, i.e. the formation of digital content in cultural, scientific and educational fields in order to preserve the cultural 				heritage and language.</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Despite several other current initiatives in Slovenia, this is the only portal with significant content and having a 			strong connective role between various institutions. In addition, dLib was the first digital centre that designed and published a 			strategic document based on other international examples (in 2006), and has itself become an example for other development policies 			and strategies in Slovenia. Despite the support of European and national projects, dLib's origins were of somewhat enthusiastic 			nature: individuals at NUK significantly contributed to its formation, design and development, through their vision and initiatives. 			 </p> 		<p class="P6">The digital library provides for the open searching of resources and ready access to journals, articles, books, 			photographs, manuscripts, sheet music, a poster database, a collection of sound recordings, higher education publications, virtual 			exhibitions and reference material. All the collections are freely accessible. </p> 		<p class="P6">Documents defining strategies and the development of the digital library:</p> 		<ul> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="Opstilling_20_-_20_punkttegn"><a href="http://www.dlib.si/documents/2008/Strategy_DKS.pdf"> <span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T4">Digital Library of Slovenia Development Strategy - dLib.si  2007-2010</span> 						</span> 					</a> </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="Opstilling_20_-_20_punkttegn"><a href="http://www.dlib.si/documents/2007/dlib_eng.pdf"><span class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T4">DLIB.SI : the digital library of Slovenia: knowledge management portal</span> 						</span> 					</a><span class="T4"> (2006)</span> </p> 			</li> 		</ul> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">Important moves in the development of the dLib definitely include the agreement with ARRS and publishers of 				scientific magazines. Namely, any scientific edition has to provide on its website at least the list of contents and an abstract of 				the publication. The editorial boards are bound by this agreement (formally obliged by ARRS) to send their files to the dLib for 				permanent storage. The cooperation between the dLib and publishers was promoted by the initiative of individuals; firstly between 				the dLib and psychologists (</span> 			<span class="T8">Psihološka Obzorja</span> 			<span class="T4"> – Horizons of Psychology) from the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Arts.</span> 		</p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">Another significant move was establishing connections with smaller, regional libraries. The MK promotes the 				digitisation of material related to local studies (postcards, local papers). Due to the lack of computer centres and competent 				experts in smaller libraries, the role of a mediator and coordinator was assumed by the dLib. Regional libraries, via calls for 				projects, apply for financial resources, which allow the scanning of material, whilst the dLib facilitates access to these 				materials. Due to the fact that calls for applications only provide funds for material scanning, the mediator and central 				coordinator prevents the materials from "being left in a drawer” - which had been the case in the past. As already mentioned, in 				order to provide open access to digitised documents (i.e. to establish access and metadata processing), the regional libraries would 				have to apply for funding from other sources for this work.</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Also, in the view of the digital library, one of the key issues is to convince the broader public of the need for a 			coordinated strategy at national level, which would provide adequate financial and other resources. Attention is also brought to the 			definition of ‘development,’ which should address the development of digitisation in a more comprehensive way, as well as 			incorporating the marketing and promotion of this material.</p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">Based on the findings of the study conducted by the Department of Library and Information Science and Book Studies at 				the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, the researchers welcome the digital library project and use its services. Their question remains 				though, what the digital library should encompass, as well as the approach to the digitisation itself. They all draw attention to 				the lack of a comprehensive approach to the digital library, which would include aspects of various professions and disciplines 				(social, cultural, economic, political and technological). In addition, more discussions and clear answers are required in relation 				to the digitisation concept, its strategic planning, study of users' requirements and adapted applications, strategies for selecting 				material for digitisation, the technology of conversion, storage and interchange of digital sources.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn13" href="#ftn13" title="body_ftn13">13</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 		</p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">From the historiographic point of view, the researchers appreciate the material held by national and regional 				libraries (the same holds true for archives, but there are no larger centres in this field). Nevertheless, there are some doubts 				about the priorities of digitising content. The driving principle behind the digitisation of library content is its preservation – 				i.e. it is prioritised by its significance for national cultural heritage and the preservation of the original material, much 				influenced by its frequency of use. This may well be a legitimate approach with regard to libraries, but it is inadequate in regard 				to the requirements of researchers. As a result, the Institute of Contemporary History launched the Project of Slovene 				Historiographic Research Infrastructure (within the SIstory web portal</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn14" href="#ftn14" title="body_ftn14">14</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4">), which from the start, takes into consideration the requirements of the history research community. Its aim is not 				to compete with the dLib (which is considerably larger and more demanding). The SIstory project – an education and research portal 				of Slovene historiography – aims to format and digitise historical material congruent with the principles and interests of the 				historical sciences. Further to promoting the findings of Slovene historiography to the general public, the SIstory portal – through 				the establishment of local, national and international connections in the field of research as well as education – also aims at 				forming a platform for international and interdisciplinary discussion.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn15" href="#ftn15" title="body_ftn15">15</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 		</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="3" width="100%">   <tbody><tr>     <td width="45%"><span class="dariah_link_button"><a href="http://www.dariah.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=75">&lt;&lt; 3.
