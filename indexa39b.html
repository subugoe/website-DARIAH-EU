<a href="http://phd.au.dk/gradschools/arts/">The Graduate School of Arts, Faculty of Arts, Aarhus University</a> invites applications for a <strong>PhD scholarship in Digital Heritage and Virtual Culture</strong>. This scholarship is available as of 1 September 2013 for a period of up to three years (5+3) or of up to four years (4+4). Candidates who are awarded the scholarship must commence their PhD programme on1 September 2013.<br /><br />Digitized and digital resources with archival institutions such as museums, libraries and research institutions are increasingly being made accessible for research, educational and public use and interaction. Digital resources and data may be both cultural heritage and everyday culture resources, and making such resources accessible and enriching them for innovative research, educational and public use and interaction are central tasks of the digital humanities.<br /><br />The Danish Digital Humanities Lab (<a href="http://dighumlab.dk/">DIGHUMLAB DK</a>), anchored at Aarhus University, is a national consortium engaged in digital humanities projects and in developing digital research infrastructures for the humanities and social sciences. With interdisciplinarity and collaborative research at the core of our vision, DIGHUMLAB can offer the PhD scholar collaborative networks with AU research centres (e.g. <a href="http://www.cavi.dk/">Centre for Advanced Visualization and Interaction</a>, Centre for Participatory IT) and with interdisciplinary research environments including Smart Aarhus and the university’s research programmes in digital design, information science, media studies, archaeology, museology, anthropology and experience economy, as well as with international research networks and projects.<br />

<br />Proposals for PhD projects should focus on research in and development of methods, tools and applications for production, representation and dissemination of digital heritage and virtual culture, and may involve applied research in the development and deployment of GIS-based projects, digital heritage archives, 3D visualizations, interactive digital simulations, design or evaluation of cultural simulations in virtual environments, or game-based learning for digital archaeology and interactive history projects.<br /><br />There is also a related research application to set up a network of digital heritage research, which Aarhus University is pursuing with other leading European Universities. If that grant is successful, the applicant may work as part of this new international network in digital heritage, or the research could be fractionally combined with the PhD scholarship in Heritage Studies.<br /><br />Salary: <a href="http://phd.au.dk/gradschools/arts/rulesandregulations/payscaleseniority/">http://phd.au.dk/gradschools/arts/rulesandregulations/payscaleseniority/</a><br /><br /><strong>Application</strong><br /><br />If you require academic guidance regarding your application for a PhD scholarship/SU PhD scholarship please contact the head of the PhD programme ICT, Media, Communication and Journalism: <a href="http://talent.au.dk/phd/arts/contacts/">http://talent.au.dk/phd/arts/contacts/</a><br /><br />Applications for the PhD scholarships/SU PhD scholarships and enrolment in the PhD degree programme can only be submitted via Aarhus University’s web-based facility.<br /><br />Guidelines for the application facility:<a href="http://talent.au.dk/phd/arts/application/application-guide/"> http://talent.au.dk/phd/arts/application/application-guide/</a><br /><br />Application deadline: 15 March 2013 at 23:59<br /><br />Reference No: 2013-218/1-116</div>
