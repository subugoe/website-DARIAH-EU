<h2>2004</h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>In 2004, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Strategy_Forum_on_Research_Infrastructures">European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures</a> (ESFRI) decided to prepare a roadmap for large-scale research infrastructures. The ESFRI Roadmap provided an overview of the needs for research infrastructures of pan-European interest. This was used to facilitate decision-making by member states and by the European Commission.</p>
<h2>2005</h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>The proposal for a research infrastructure dedicated to the arts and humanities was formulated in 2005. This was named DARIAH, for Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. Following the ESFRI call for proposals for large-scale European research infrastructures, four data centres from the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands jointly submitted a proposal for DARIAH.</p>
<h2>2006</h2>
<p>On the 19th of October 2006, ESFRI presented Europe's first roadmap for research infrastructures. The roadmap included 35 projects of pan-European interest and scientific excellence. In total, six social sciences and/or humanities projects were on the roadmap. Five of these moved forward and started work to prepare for their actual construction: CLARIN, CESSDA, ESS, SHARE and DARIAH.</p>
<p>Not long after the publication of the ESFRI Roadmap, the new Research Framework Programme (FP7) was launched. The first series of FP7 calls included a call for proposals for preparatory work for ESFRI Roadmap projects. This call was part of the “Capacities” specific programme, under “Research Infrastructures”.</p>
<h2>2007</h2>
<p>A proposal called “Preparing DARIAH” was submitted under that call in early May 2007. The proposal was developed by the DARIAH consortium, which by this time had grown from the initial 4 partners from 4 countries to 13 partners from 10 countries.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2007 the proposal was evaluated by international experts. The results of this evaluation were positive, and this set the stage for the commencement of contract negotiations.</p>
<h2>2008</h2>
<p>The European Commission (EC) invited the partners of the Preparing DARIAH proposal to meet to discuss contract negotiations in early 2008. The invitation also included some suggestions for improvement of the project. These suggestions are taken into account in the preparation of the “Description of Work”, the official document that became part of the EC-DARIAH grant agreement.</p>
<p>That same year saw the addition of another partner to the consortium, bringing the total to 14 partners from 10 countries. In September 2008, the official "Preparing DARIAH" phase of the project began, with work set to continue for two years. The overall objective of the preparatory phase of the project is to move the initiative forward and be ready for the construction of DARIAH by late 2010. The preparatory stage is intended to set up the physical, strategic and human elements of the research infrastructure, and to ensure it is on a firm legal and financial footing. The work in the preparatory project addresses coordination, strategic, financial, governance, logistical, legal and technical issues, as well as management and dissemination activities to support this work.</p>
<h2>2009</h2>
<p>In early 2009, the duration of the preparatory phase was extended by six months from the original 24. This pushed the conclusion of the "Preparing DARIAH" phase back to the end of February 2011.</p>
<p>In the interest of branching out into European nations which are not currently represented among DARIAH membership, three "Associate Partners" were admitted in 2009. While these partners have no voting rights and no formal responsibility for deliverables, they are nonetheless encouraged to collaborate with DARIAH partners in any area of relevance.</p>
