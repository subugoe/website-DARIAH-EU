The technical work packages have conducted an initial survey among the DARIAH partners to find out more about the existing technical and conceptual expertise, and raised awareness for DARIAH at several conferences and workshops.  <p><strong>Survey shows differences in expertise among participating partners</strong><br /> This initial survey showed great differences in expertise, and it is expected to be one of the main challenges to at the same time support the work on national infrastructures in less advanced countries and to make existing and future national infrastructure work together. </p> <p><strong>The DARIAH technical work packages have already started to raise awareness for DARIAH</strong><br /> DARIAH was represented at several more technically oriented conferences and workshops such as the IEEE conference on e-Science and Grid technologies in Bangalore, and the Open Grid Forums 21 and 22, in Manchester and Seattle. Additionally, DARIAH was presented at workshops on cyber-infrastructures for arts and humanities at the Digital Humanities conference in Urbana-Champaign in 2007, and at the UK based conference on Digital Resource in the Arts and Humanities. </p> The feedback at these events has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive and showcased Europe as a research and development leader in the domain of research infrastructures for arts and humanities.</div>
