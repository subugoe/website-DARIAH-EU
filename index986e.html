<p> <strong>Date:</strong> Thursday 17th and Friday 18th November 2011<br />   <strong>Venue:</strong> University of Copenhagen, Denmark<br />   <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://cst.ku.dk/sdh2011/">http://cst.ku.dk/sdh2011/</a></p> <p> SDH2011 is the second conference that is jointly organized by the <strong><a href="http://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="http://localhost:8666/">DARIAH</a> </strong>initiatives,  which are building the European research  infrastructure for the  humanities and related disciplines. </p><p>Digital technologies have the potential to transform the types of research questions that we ask in the Humanities, allowing us both to address traditional questions in new and exciting ways but also to answer questions that we were not even aware we could ask – hence the title of this conference. How can digital humanities help us not just to find the answers to our research questions more quickly and more easily, but also to formulate research questions we would never have been able to ask without access to large quantities of digital data and sophisticated tools for their analysis? Supporting Digital Humanities will be a forum for the discussion of these innovations, and of the ways in which these new forms of research can be facilitated and supported.<br /><br />CLARIN and DARIAH are creating European research infrastructures for the humanities and related disciplines. SDH2011 aims to bring together infrastructure providers and users from the communities involved in these two infrastructure initiatives. The conference will consist of a number of topical sessions where providers and users will present and discuss results, obstacles and opportunities for digitally-supported humanities research. Participants are encouraged to engage with honest assessments of the intellectual problems and practical barriers in an open and constructive atmosphere.<br /><br />The first SDH conference in 2010 gave a broad and multi-facetted presentation of the domains of interest to CLARIN and DARIAH. This time we have chosen a somewhat more focussed approach, concentrating on two major themes, but not excluding other themes of interest for the humanities. The two themes are:<br /><br />•    Sound and movement – music, spoken word, dance and theatre<br />•    Texts and things – texts, and the relationship between texts and material artefacts, such as manuscripts, stone or other carriers of texts</p><p>For further information please visit the conference website: <a href="http://cst.ku.dk/sdh2011/">http://cst.ku.dk/sdh2011/</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
