More information about the national  roadmap for research infrastructure can be found at: <a href="http://en.fi.dk/publications/2011/danish-roadmap-for-research-infrastructure-2011">http://en.fi.dk/publications/2011/danish-roadmap-for-research-infrastructure-2011</a>.</p> <p>The research infrastructure DIGHUMLAB will support digital humanistic  and social science research and act as the unifying, virtual gateway to  relevant digital and digitalized resources for the humanities and  social sciences.
