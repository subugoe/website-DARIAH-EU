<div align="justify"><img src="http://localhost:8666/images/stories/vcc1.png" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="180" align="right" />The <strong>DARIAH e-Infrastructure</strong> will be a shared technology platform for research in the arts and humanities (A+H) and is carried out by the<strong> Virtual Competency Centre 1 (VCC1).</strong><br /><ul><li>to establish a shared technology platform for A+H research</li><li>primary target group: other VCCs; innovators and adopters of technical infrastructure (both infrastructure projects, institutions and research networks, as well as individual developers)</li></ul><strong>Goals and Scope</strong><br /><br />The VCC1 e-Infrastructure establishes the technological basis for DARIAH to be a trusted intermediary, in which community-developed data and tools can be shared and integrated. VCC1 will:<br /><ul><li>establish infrastructure services and standards which ensure interoperability across the whole DARIAH ecosystem</li><li>support the creation and evolution of local data stores for the trustworthy management of research data (e.g. national data archives, special collections)</li><li>foster the stability, openness and re-usability of scholarly tools and collaborative research environments (e.g. humanities centres, researchers in A+H)</li><li>interact with institutional partners, A+H development groups, and related actors to ensure the quality, permanence and growth of e-infrastructure and technical services in the A+H</li></ul>The VCC1 establishes a range of technical infrastructure components that are described in more detail in the upcoming section "services" as well as the "DARIAH technical report" and the "DARIAH technical roadmap" documents.<br /><br /><strong>A+H Infrastructure Services</strong><br /><br />Rather than a monolithic, controlled infrastructure, DARIAH is intended to be a means of linking up people, services and data for research in the A+H. The infrastructure services to be developed and hosted by this task establish a framework and interoperability across the diverse, decentralised tools and services in the DARIAH ecosystem, as well as with other infrastructures, including ESFRI initiatives. Some of the core services required for this ecosystem to emerge include an overarching authentication and single-sign-on infrastructure, PID services, infrastructure management and others.<br /><br /><strong>Reference Software Packages</strong><br /><br />Emerging A+H centres may employ the software packages to be created in this task to establish their technology platform, using a complete software stack or a smaller set of tools and services to make their services DARIAH-compliant. The DARIAH reference software will be built upon existing technologies and 1 0 addresses both the needs of research environments as well as the building of a trusted repository for preserving research data. Together, these two software stacks cater for the whole research lifecycle in active usage, preservation, and reuse of research data.<br /><br /><strong>Preservation Infrastructure</strong><br /><br />This service supports and promotes A+H data centres in their efforts to ensure trustworthy preservation. DARIAH support is both technical and organisational, whereby VCC1 provides guidance regarding technical preservation infrastructure and VCC3 regarding preservation policies and standards. One of the key activities of this support service is to pool preservation experiences across existing A+H trusted repositories and to link them to the findings of the e-infrastructure and preservation communities (e.g. preservation registries, technology watch).<br /><br /><strong>Data Federation and Interoperability</strong><br /><br />The DARIAH data backbone is designed to be open and decentralised. It differs from existing repository federations such as Europeana and DRIVER in various ways:<br /><ul><li>The primary use case for Europeana and DRIVER is a federated search. DARIAH offers the federation mechanisms for other, research-oriented applications across diverse data sources, such as analysis, visualisation, and task management. Anybody can build respective applications on federated sources in the DARIAH network.</li><li>DARIAH is decentralised. Any source can be added or excluded in specific application environments, and different subsets of data sources can co-exist.</li><li>DARIAH is very light-weight. Its openness and flexibility offers the range of opportunities described above, but it also means that writing new applications that operate on the federated DARIAH backbone may require more effort than simply querying an existing database.</li></ul></div><div align="justify">This activity is responsible for the infrastructure services needed to establish such a data backbone, and aims to provide a set of best practices and samples for building cross-repository interoperability channels (e.g. OAI-PMH, OAI-ORE, Linked Data).<br /><br /><strong>Developer Community</strong><br /><br />DARIAH's architecture of participation encourages the A+H community at large to contribute to their own data and tools. Besides technical standards and gateways, this activity aims to provide development and communication facilities (e.g. code repository, issue tracker) to trigger a collaborative community.<br /><br /><strong>A+H Service Environment</strong><br /><br />The digital humanities are a large and heterogeneous community with a rich set of tools and methodologies. The previous activity (Developer Community) aims to harness the activities of the A+H community related to software development, acknowledging that many of those tools being created may be discontinued or superseded in short time periods. The current activity aims to identify and extend the lifespan of those services of more permanent value, and to make them available to the whole A+H community. Some of the infrastructure components include semantic reference tools, such as dictionaries, thesauri, or geo-referencing services. VCC1 will create and host these reference tools; their content data, however, will be contributed by VCC2 and/or the A+H community. In addition to hosting key reference services for the A+H community, this support service establishes best practice guidelines for ensuring the openness and interoperability of components in the A+H service environment.<br /><br /><strong>A+H Research environment demonstrators</strong><br /><br />This service creates user applications, tailored to the needs of a particular research context. These may be prototypes or even productive DARIAH-based services for demonstration purposes, and are built on behalf of and following the specifications of VCC2. Initially, two demonstrators will be built: a generic search service across all DARIAH resources with specialised functionalities on subsets of the data (e.g. faceted browsing, geo-visualisation), and a frontend tool to manage collections across heterogeneous sources.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">For further information please contact our VCC heads <a href="mailto:Karlheinz.Moerth@oeaw.ac.at">Charly Moerth</a>, <a href="mailto:cao@mpdl.mpg.de">Ye Cao</a> or <a href="mailto:rene.smolarski@sub.uni-goettingen.de">René Smorlarki</a> <br /></div>
