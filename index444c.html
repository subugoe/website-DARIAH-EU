DARIAH will engage with those audiences in managed formal and informal meetings, polished information packages and PR campaigns, as well as in the coordination of DARIAH's response and participation in, for example, funding calls.<br /><br /><strong>Impact & Value</strong></p><p align="justify">This activity assesses the impact of DARIAH and measures the ‘added value’ that it brings through quantitative and qualitative measures. It will focus on how DARIAH facilitates the transfer of knowledge and expertise between (a) the relevant disciplines within the humanities (themselves often silos) and (b) the humanities and other areas such as qualitative social sciences, computer science, information science, and bioinformatics.<br /><br /><strong>Outreach</strong></p><p align="justify">DARIAH seeks mutually beneficial relationships with a wide community of stakeholders which potentially feed into A+H research, including cultural tourism, industrial partners and publishers. The DARIAH summer schools, organised by the VCC2, in attempt to bring scholars of related disciplines of the humanities and arts together, contribute to the task 4.4. in terms of calls, released to already interested groups of stakeholders in the scholarly community.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Ensuring Capacity in DARIAH</strong></p><p align="justify">This activity ensures the consistency and growth of the DARIAH network of partners. To achieve this, it identifies contact points for potential national partners in Europe potential institutional partners potential industrial partners gaps in skills and resources within the DARIAH network This activity also ensures the adequate incorporation of the skills of new DARIAH partners into relevant VCCs.</p><p align="justify">For further information please contact our VCC head <a href="mailto:dwinter@mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de">Dirk Wintergrün</a></p></div>
