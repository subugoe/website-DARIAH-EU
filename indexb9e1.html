<p><img src="http://www.dariah.eu/images/stories/nedimah.jpg" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" align="right" />The NeDiMAH working groups "Digital Scholarly Editions" and "Using Large-Scale Text Collections for Research" are organising an expert meeting and a workshop (both on 21 November 2012)  at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, in The Hague, The Netherlands. Proposals are invited before <strong>10th of September 2012</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. EXPERT MEETING on Digital Scholarly Editions</strong><br /><br />The working group on Digital Scholarly Editions of the European Research Network NeDiMAH (Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities, <a href="http://www.nedimah.eu/">http://www.nedimah.eu</a>) is organising an Experts’ Seminar on Wednesday, 21 November 2012 at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands in The Hague. The seminar is being held in conjunction with the 9th conference of the European Society for Textual Scholarship, ‘Editing Fundamentals:<br />Historical and Literary Paradigms in Source Editing’, 22-24 November 2012 in Amsterdam (<a href="http://www.textualscholarship.eu/conference-2012.html">http://www.textualscholarship.eu/conference-2012.html</a>).<br /><br />The NeDiMAH working group on Digital Scholarly Editions seeks to promote the use of existing digital technologies in the production of scholarly editions, bringing together experts from a wide variety of disciplines and time-periods to establish the state of the art and recommend a set of best practices in order to ensure maximum interoperability and long-term preservation of, and access to, digital data. In particular, the topics<br />which will be addressed at the seminar are: • Theory: What is a digital edition? What is its purpose, and who are the intended users? What, in short, is the nature of the digital editorial endeavour? • Production: What are the various stages in the production of a digital edition?<br />Standards for digital imaging and basic text encoding are now fairly well established, but there remain several fundamental issues yet to be resolved, such as how one can best deal with documenting and representing textual variation and the basic question of editing the text as opposed to editing the document (i.e. the text in situ). To what extent are collaborative/distributed editions the way forward?<br /><br />Proposals of not more than 500 words are invited by the 10th of September (to <a href="mailto:mjd@hum.ku.dk">mjd at hum.ku.dk</a> or <a href="mailto:elena.pierazzo@kcl.ac.uk">elena.pierazzo at kcl.ac.uk</a>). Please note that for this seminar we are particularly interested in methodological and theoretical contributions, rather than project reports. Speakers will be allotted 15 minutes for their presentations followed by 10 minutes of discussion. The seminar will close with a general round-table discussion.</p>

<p><br /><strong>2. WORKSHOP Using Large-Scale Text Collections for Research</strong><br /><br />The NeDiMAH working group Using Large-Scale Text Collections for Research also hosts a workshop on Wednesday 21 November 2012 and also at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, in The Hague, The Netherlands.<br /><br />The workshop Using Large-Scale Text Collections for Research: Status and Needs will be used to inventorize the availability of text corpora for researchers from different disciplines in the participating countries and languages. How large are the available corpora? For what purposes were they created? What kinds of mark-up do they contain? And which tools are available to help mining the corpora? What is missing in both texts and<br />tools to make the corpus also useful for other research disciplines than the one it was originally created for? The first part of the day-long workshop will be used for an introductory paper by the group leader, followed by short papers of the participants sketching the situation in their country and language(s) and the needs of their own specific research discipline. The rest of the day will be dedicated to discussions about the topics addressed<br />during the first parts: what are the shared positive points in the different countries/languages/disciplines? Is there an overlap in the different needs that were expressed? What can we learn from each other? Where can we push the developments further through a shared approach?<br /><br />Abstracts are invited before 10 September and can be sent to <a href="http://www.dariah.eu/karina.van.dalen@huygens.knaw.nl">karina.van.dalen at huygens.knaw.nl </a><br />Details about the abstract and about reimbursement possibilities can be found at <a href="http://drupal.p164224.webspaceconfig.de/workgroups/using-large-scale-text-collections-research">http://drupal.p164224.webspaceconfig.de/workgroups/using-large-scale-text-collections-research</a></p></div>
