<h2 class="western" lang="en-GB">2.1. The Survey's Framework</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The mission of the survey is twofold: to identify the national policy makers and assess their policy statements, and to contact individual institutions engaged in the arts and humanities in order to investigate the grounds for further cooperation. The objectives of the survey on the one hand and time limitations and means at our disposal on the other, determined the methodology we adopted. Two main activities supported the research: internet desk research and a survey questionnaire. The desk research entailed an investigation of institutions and public agencies, museums and research centres, in order to obtain information on their role and contribution to the formulation and implementation of a digital research strategy in Greece. The resulting list was filtered and the selected institutions received the survey questionnaire, which is the second part of the study. This activity was performed through direct contact with these organizations, using an open source web-based application designed to support online survey questionnaires.</p>
<h2 class="western" lang="en-GB">2.2. Tools used to support the research</h2>
<p>The internet research involved a commonly used procedure through “Google search” and the following of links to other links. The starting point was the use of keywords leading to national sites, which in turn provided other specific and/or relevant links. Besides, a decision had to be taken on the method to be used for storing and managing all these information links and the documents that resulted from them. A plethora of digital bibliographical tools that were available on line were evaluated. The final selection of <em>zotero</em> was determined by its high rated reviews and a test on our part to confirm that it met the survey's requirements.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">A similar research process was also adopted for the selection of a tool that creates survey questionnaires, consulting public reviews and performing test trials. Indeed, this was a far more complicated task, since it involved testing more than one applications on a variety of query types, their export and administration possibilities, as well as their limitations on the number of participants and on data preservation.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Experimentation for the selection of the questionnaire tool began on 5 July 2009 and the final selection of the tool and the creation of the survey were completed on July 10th. Then began the task of e-mailing the on-line questionnaire link to the selected recipients. The survey questionnaire was addressed to 100 institutions. Thirty one (31) responses were received between August 4th and October 14th. Five (5) of them preferred the traditional analog method of printing, filling out and sending the questionnaire via post. Many questionnaires (47) were partially completed, while fifty one (51) appeared abandoned (no fields were completed). It has to be noted here that, only the fully completed questionnaires were taken into account in the analysis and the statistics.</p>
<p>The questionnaire consists of four (4) sections and twenty-three (23) questions. Ten (10) questions concern the organization profile and one more (in free text) refers to the objectives and strategy of the institution surveyed. The rest of the questions (nos. 12-23) are formatted so as to provide a range of options (forced-choice questions, multiple choice questions and check boxes with default values of expression and an option to complete an additional value). An effort has been made to combine the qualitative and the quantitative approach in order to represent both individual characteristics and common trends or percentages.</p>
<h2 class="western" lang="en-GB">2.3. Selection of the Survey Participants</h2>
<p>Prior to the selection of the survey participants, in order to aggregate all organizations possibly involved in the humanities and in the formulation of a related strategy, an initial survey was conducted. The outcome of this first survey was a list of diverse institutions (academic institutions, universities, museums, public agencies and cultural organizations). From this list we proceeded to the selection of the survey participants according to a number of premises. Having in mind the goals of the present study, a set of criteria were developed in order to proceed with the selection of the participants in the survey questionnaire.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The following criteria were taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>arts     and humanities&nbsp;discipline(s)     served</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">type     of institution (e.g. Archive, Library, Museum)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">institutional     category (e.g. public, private sector)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">nationwide     representation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">availability     of material and provision of services on the web.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The criteria used for the selection of the prospective participants were also used to produce valuable statistical data and observations. Indeed, the features of the institutions that responded are revealing: Research centres (36%) and museums (30%) represent the highest rate of response compared to universities (7%), libraries (7%), government agencies (7% ) and smaller collections and archives (10%). When it comes to disciplines, Archaeology (23%), History (27%) and Arts (26%) hold pride of place, while Linguistics and Folklore rank lower. The institutional legal status of most of the participants is from the public sector (60%) and non-profit organizations (30%), with the private sector hardly reaching a significant rate (10%). Respectively, as was expected, most of the participants are located in the capital of Greece, Athens (70%), another 20% in Thessaloniki, the second biggest city in Greece, and the rest in smaller cities. One is a Greek institution based abroad (Venice, Italy).</p>
<p>The statistical analysis attests to the genuine interest of research centres in digital humanities, while this is not the case for government agencies and smaller private foundations. Universities are not adequately represented in the survey, a fact that cannot be attributed to a lack of interest on the part of the academic community. A plausible interpretation could be, not that universities turn their back on digital research, but rather that the questionnaire was addressed to departments and not to individuals (professors and other research and teaching staff), a procedure that did not encourage the expected response. The participation of a significant number of organizations of public legal status is a noteworthy fact, that could be interpreted as the first sign of awareness of the merits of digital scholarship. History, Archaeology and Arts appear to be more mature than the other disciplines with regard to the adoption of digital scholarship, with their percentages equally distributed, while Linguistics and Folklore studies appear less involved.</p>
<p>The statistical results are available in the Appendix C: Participant's Categorization.</p>
<h2 class="western" lang="en-GB">2.4. Survey Constraints and Limitations</h2>
<p>Our decisions on how and when the survey should be carried out were largely determined by time constraints and the availability of tools. The period of three (3) months was considered adequate for the conduct of the survey. An important negative factor for the outcome of the investigation was that it had to be performed during the summer months, a period when most people take their leaves and organizations tend to function at a slower pace. This and the need to approach a very large number of participants (approx. 100) were the two basic reasons, for which the research was based exclusively on digital media and not on face-to-face interviews.</p>
<p>A few additional words are necessary on the methodology that was adopted. Considerable thought was given to the formulation of the questions of the questionnaire, with the aim of obtaining answers with the desired precision. Questionnaires normally include an assortment of forced-choice questions (e.g. True-False) or open-ended questions (e.g. short answer essay), to which participants are asked to respond. No doubt, certain assumptions were necessarily made while drafting the questionnaire, in order to get answers to questions that required a statement on the participants' part. Although considerable care was taken to produce a clearly stated questionnaire, it is quite possible that the use of a certain terminology with which the digital humanist is well acquainted may have caused some confusion among people with little or no familiarity with the subject.</p>
