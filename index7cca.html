<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Re-writing the digital landscape</span></strong></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Earlier  this month EGI (European Grid Infrastructure) signed a Letter of Intent with two European  Commission funded projects aiming to provide the arts and humanities  with an e-Infrastructure of their own. The two projects, DARIAH and  CLARIN, both signed the three-way agreement, which has the express  intention of ensuring that technology developed by the two ESFRI  projects and EGI are compatible and provides the best service to their  users. The agreement also provides a blueprint for similar arrangements  between EGI and other user communities that are interested in exploring  grid technology but are temporarily constrained from establishing a  Virtual Research Community. <br /></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span>While  there is a wide range of research using the European grid, the arts and  humanities are currently under represented but both DARIAH and CLARIN  aim to remedy this. CLARIN (<strong>C</strong>ommon <strong>La</strong>nguage <strong>R</strong>esources and Technology <strong>In</strong>frastructure) is focussed on creating tools and resources for the language community while DARIAH (<strong>D</strong>igit<strong>a</strong>l <strong>R</strong>esearch <strong>I</strong>nfrastructure for the <strong>A</strong>rts and <strong>H</strong>umanities)  supports the wider humanities and arts community. The two projects are  part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI)  programme. This initiative helps to support a coherent approach to  policy-making on research infrastructures in Europe so that researchers get the resources/technologies they need.</span><span> </span>  </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>This  latest agreement cements the relationship between the 2 ESFRI projects  and EGI.eu helping all three to develop common tools and technologies  while exploring further opportunities for collaboration. Connecting EGI  with the infrastructures developed by these two projects will have  benefits for the sites within partner countries providing the resources,  benefits for the countries themselves in terms of integrating the  resource centres with the EGI monitoring and support services and  finally, benefits for the research communities in terms of support,  advice and influence over the evolving infrastructure. The first  priority however is to understand the needs of the communities that  DARIAH and CLARIN represent so that they can build and manage an  infrastructure for their users. The areas of greatest concern are; data  storage and availability, the hosting and monitoring of services as well  as authentication and authorisation issues.</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Chief  Community Officer, Steve Brewer said: “For EGI this is the first step  in establishing and welcoming a valuable new user community onto the  European grid, DARIAH and CLARIN represent a broad range of interests  across the arts, humanities and social sciences with, between them, a  wealth of digitally-enabled methods and tools to integrate with the  infrastructure.”</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Outside the  agreement with EGI CLARIN and DARIAH have also agreed to co-organise the  SDH 2011 conference in Copenhagen later in the year. The meeting, the  full name of which is “Supporting the Digital Humanities: Answering the  unaskable”, will be held in the Danish capital on the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>  of November. It will provide a forum for discussing the benefits of the  e-Infrastructures to the arts and humanities alongside how new forms of  research can be facilitated and supported.</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span>You can learn more about the agreement and the two projects at <a href="http://www.egi.eu/collaboration/CLARIN_DARIAH.html">http://www.egi.eu/collaboration/CLARIN_DARIAH.html</a></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span>More information about SDH 2011 can be found at <a href="http://cst.ku.dk/sdh2011/">http://cst.ku.dk/sdh2011/</a></span></p></div>
