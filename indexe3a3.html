While it touches upon  broader theoretical, methodological and technology issues, the forum  will focus on receiving feedback, nurturing critical discussion and  reaching consensus amongst participants on the empirical study and  conceptual modeling work on scholarly information practices and  requirements for scholarly e-infrastructure conducted by DCU as part of <em>DARIAH</em>.  It will be structured in six two-hour sessions, each dealing with a  particular question or set of questions relevant to the objectives of <em>DARIAH</em> process scoping (WP8.1) work, based on a combination of invited  contributions and open discussion amongst participants.</p> <p>The Experts Forum forms part of the work within the conceptual workpackage of <em>DARIAH</em> (<a href="http://localhost:8666/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=35">WP8</a>), based on a combination of scholarly information behaviour literature survey with qualitative research on how arts and humanities researchers interact with information. It contributes to the development of a process model of scholarly information work, and also feed into the specification of an object model for information resources and scholarly objects pertinent to humanities research, an important factor in determining digital infrastructure requirements for scholarship. <br />As part of process scoping work in DARIAH, interview-based, qualitative research was conducted on humanities researchers' actual information practices and opinions on digital information use. Its results concern questions regarding:</p> <ul> <li>the actual kinds of information work performed by mainstream and digital humanities researchers, as part of particular research activities, and their implications on the specification of digital repositories, services and tools for arts and humanities research; </li> <li>the relationship between  research activities and particular kinds of information objects (including scholarly objects) for specific research fields; and,</li> <li>the relative importance of particular "scholarly primitives" for arts and humanities research and the way they are, or could be, supported by specific digital research methods, procedures, services and tools. </li> </ul> <p>Substantive research results were consolidated with findings from an extensive survey of prior studies on scholarly information behaviour in a conceptual model of scholarly information activity, which accounts for relationships between user requirements stemming from research information processes and relevant digital services and tools. </p> <p><strong>Dates:</strong> Thursday, 10 June, Friday, 11 June 2010</p> <p><strong>Venue:</strong> Kostis Palamas Building, University of Athens, Akadimias 48 and Sina, <a href="http://old.uoa.gr/kkp/">http://old.uoa.gr/kkp/</a></p> <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:experts.forum@dcu.gr">experts.forum@dcu.gr</a></p></div>
