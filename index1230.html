<div class="content"><p><strong>Work package 8 – Technical work: Conceptual modelling</strong></p> <p>The general objective is to develop a quality and interoperability layer for a coherent, interlinked and collaboratively maintained virtual infrastructure, and to further user-orientation and preservation within the open DARIAH ecosystem. There are four major activities:</p> <p><strong>1) Scope a study for process models:</strong><br /> A model of the processes in the scientific domains will be developed in order to embed future DARIAH assets and services in the scientific discourse by:<br /> •	Collation and analysis of current practices at the partner data centres,<br /> • Analysis of the availability for reference and supplementary material and their possible requirements to further the linkage between content, services, and essentially scientists and their specific research, and by<br /> • Creating a reference model of the scientific discourse and the practices and requirements of scientific work in different disciplines.</p> <p><strong>2) Scope a study for object models:</strong><br /> The partners’ digital assets will be evaluated and recommendations on their representation and management will be made by:<br /> • A survey amongst partners of currently available digital assets, metadata requirements, practices on data ingest and other management workflows and associated issues,<br /> • The mapping of existing approaches against (international) standards for object models with regard to criteria including accessibility, interoperability, multi-linguality, and persistent identification,<br /> • Establishment of a reference data continuum with best practices for different scientific domains and their data types at their various life cycle stages, and by<br /> • The description of methodology and relevant standard(s) for the collection level in order to allow the design, development and management of such functions in the DARIAH demonstrators.</p> <p><strong>3) Evaluate DARIAH’s demonstrators:</strong><br /> The combination of process and object models will be evaluated by applying them in specific scenarios.</p> <p>The two DARIAH demonstrators will showcase how DARIAH can integrate heterogeneous application domains into a single infrastructure, interlink them where possible, and thereby enhance service for the targeted user groups.</p> <p><strong>4) Recommendations and Roadmap:</strong><br /> •	Collation and alignment of the results from the process and object models.<br /> • Recommendations on further activities within DARIAH (research and maintenance), as well as possible dissemination and standardisation activities.<br /> •	Liaising with other work packages to ensure the cohesiveness of the recommendations and further activities.</p> </div>
