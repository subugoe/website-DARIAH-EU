<h2 lang="en-GB">1.1. Survey background and goals</h2>
<p>The present current status survey constitutes a part of a broader research, which was also conducted in two other European DARIAH partner countries (Ireland and Slovenia). The research results are intended to provide information for the formulation of the DARIAH implementation strategy. The Greek study attempts to draw a comprehensive picture of the national strategy on digital research. This picture is the outcome of desk research, in which the primary set of questions to be answered were whether Greece has developed a cultural policy for the arts and humanities and to what extent are organizations aware of digital humanities as a new methodology. Furthermore, an important objective of the survey was to determine the level of their awareness, since this information will be a valuable guide for the ways in which these organizations will be approached or engaged for the future of DARIAH. For this purpose a questionnaire was planned and addressed to a selection of research centres and policy makers.</p>
<h2 class="western">1.2. Defining Arts and Humanities in Greece</h2>
<p>The traditional and long established arts and humanities disciplines in Greece cover the following domains: archaeology, history, philosophy, theology, linguistics, literature, music, folklore, ethnology, performing and visual arts. Study, research and teaching represent the key action areas for each one of these domains. The same action areas form the fundamental constituents of the digital humanities methodological approach, whereas the production of knowledge involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of knowledge, all with the use of digital media.</p>
<p>In the particular case of Greece, digital humanities or e-humanities are newly imported terms used by a limited number of researchers working in research centres and by even fewer scholars in the broader community of humanists. However, gradually, changes in scholarly environment have occurred, mainly as a result of EU-funded initiatives, such as a number of large scale digitization projects that took place during the last decade. Largely thanks to these initiatives and the resulting availability of masses of digital resources, computer technologies were integrated into the research practice of the academic and research institutions, museums, collections and archives. But this is only the beginning of a series of steps that have to be taken in the direction of promoting digital scholarship. While some progress has been made, it has been slowed down by an outdated institutional framework as well as by limitations in funding. However, the scholarly community in Greece is now aware of the need for a digital research framework and initiatives are under way to create such a framework that will relate to and cooperate with a European scholarship network.</p>
