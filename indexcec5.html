<p>The Open Humanities Hack was the first Digital Humanities hack organised jointly by the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx">Kings College London Department of Digital Humanities</a>, <a href="http://localhost:8666/">DARIAH</a>, the <a href="http://dm2e.eu/">Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana (DM2E)</a> project and our <a href="http://humanities.okfn.org/">Open Humanities Working Group</a>.</p>  <p>A group of 15 people gathered in the grand confines of the Large Committee Room at Kings College London, Guys Campus.</p>  <p>The principle of the day was simple: bring a mix of researchers, data  providers and coders together to hack on new open-source applications  developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation, the DM2E project and the  Kings College Digital Humanities Department.</p>  <h3><strong>Results:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>ReclineJS Timeliner EHRI</strong></p>  <p>The <a href="http://timeliner.reclinejs.com/">Timeliner</a> is an open-source tool based on the JavaScript Library <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/recline/">ReclineJS</a>.  It makes it easy to create visually compelling timelines from Google  Spreadsheets. An example of the kind of timelines is one I made earlier  this week on Medieval Philosophers is <a href="http://timeliner.reclinejs.com/?backend=gdocs&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al6mO9_3Hr2PdGZnRjEwUWxOekhreTNNZEFEMWRZbkE%23gid=0#explorer">here</a>. If you’re a medievalist, and you think we’ve missed anyone, update the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al6mO9_3Hr2PdGZnRjEwUWxOekhreTNNZEFEMWRZbkE#gid=0">Google Spreadsheet</a> here to update the timeline.</p>  <p>The Timeliner group, led by Mike Bryant, were working with the <a href="http://www.ehri-project.eu/">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure Project {EHRI)</a>  database currently with 700 test records in it of Neo4J database that  contains harvested archival collections descriptions about the  Holocaust.</p><p><strong>Semantically annotating the Walters Museum Manuscripts</strong></p>  <p>The second group used <a href="http://thepund.it/">Pundit</a>, a powerful annotation tool being developed as part of <a href="http://dm2e.eu/">DM2E</a>,  to semantically annotate facsimile images of manuscripts. Simone Fonda a  developer from Net7 the company behind Pundit, opened the hack with a  presentation on the current state of the tool.</p><p>The group set out to <a href="http://www.thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/W533/data/W.533/sap/W533_000261_sap.jpg">annotate a number of digitised facsimile images from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore</a> by dividing up each written line of the manuscript regions defined by automatically generated polygons.</p>  <p>The polygons that were generated then needed to be associated with a  JSON annotation giving the line number, to which comments and  transcriptions could then be attached in Pundit. On Day 2 the group also  experimented with using OCR for the regions of the image that were  picked out further.</p><p><strong>Visualising Dark Star</strong></p><p>The final group formed around the idea of analysing and visualising narrative in works of art. They used <a href="http://contextus.net/">Contextus</a> the front-end of a triple-store that stores data about events in literary works and the characters involved.</p>  <p>The first task was to pull the data out of the triple-store via a  SPARQL query, this data was then loaded into a database by one of the  team. The group chose John Carpenter’s film “Dark Star”.</p>  <p>The team then used D3 JS to visualise the events as a scatter graph.  Along the X-axis you can see the numbered events of Dark Star, and along  the Y-axis the characters involved in the play.</p><p>More detailed information is available here <a href="http://okfn.org/events/humanities-hack-november-2012/">http://okfn.org/events/humanities-hack-november-2012/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
