<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">The report  not only offers an overview of the present activities and challenges in the  field of research data in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the United  Kingdom but also outlines an action programme for the four countries in  realising a collaborative data infrastructure. This report is a response to the  Riding the Wave report which was published by the High Level Expert Group on  Scientific Data. It was commissioned by the Knowledge Exchange Primary Research  Data Working group and was written by Leo Waaijers and Maurits van der  Graaff.</span></p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">In the  report four key drivers are addressed: incentives for researchers, training in  relation to researchers in their role as data producers and users of information  infrastructure, organisational and technical infrastructure and, finally, the  funding of the infrastructure. The report offers recommendations for actions in  each of these fields for the partners and others, not only in the four partner  countries, but also beyond these borders.</span>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Based on  the overview of the present situation in the four Knowledge Exchange partner  countries, the report formulates three long-term strategic  goals:</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt"><span><span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Data  sharing will be part of the academic culture</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt"><span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Data  logistics will be an integral component of academic professional  life</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Data  infrastructure will be sound, both operationally and  financially.</span></li></ol>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">Robert  Madelin, the director general of Information Society and Media at the European  Commission remarked on the report: "The report is a very timely input. The  European Commission is working on the foundations for an Open Data Strategy for  Europe which will be very soon communicated to EU Member States and the European  Parliament. It is extremely useful to have with this report not only an overview  of what is taking place in four European countries, but of possible actions for  the future taking into account the importance of open data for the European  economy and society." </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">The report  is presented today at the Knowledge Exchange workshop “Research Data Management  – Activities and Challenges” in Bonn.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt">The report  is available for download at: <a href="http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=469" title="blocked::http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=469">http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=469</a></span></p>
