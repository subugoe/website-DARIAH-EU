The main topic of the conference was to overview the cultural content in the fields of culture, education, lifelong learning 				and cultural tourism already published online, exchange experiences and identify mechanisms that promote the integration of cultural 				content online to allow the best possible accessibility, as well as the recommendations of the </span> 			<span class="T8">Commission on the Digitisation and Online Accessibility of Cultural Material, and Digital Preservation 				(2006/585/EU)</span> 			<span class="T4"> as well as Unesco's </span> 			<span class="T8">Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions 2005. </span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Major emphasis was put on support for the establishment of dialogue between the authors of digital cultural content and 			agents in the web environment; support to the reinforcement of national frameworks in terms of interoperability which would connect 			digital cultural content of museums, archives, libraries and other national and local cultural institutions. The main role was 			attributed to Europeana, which allows the development of multilingualism in the web environment both in terms of creation as well as 			distribution of multilingual cultural content, and the development and use of multilingual user interfaces. Special attention was 			drawn to the accessibility of cultural web content in space and time via GIC technologies and the expansion of free access to cultural 			content across all technological platforms in particular to the most vulnerable groups.</p> 		<p class="P6">The Europeana database is provided by the National and University Library, whereas the Europeana Local - which will also 			incorporate digitised material from public libraries, regional museums and archives - was joined by the Celje public library and 			Gorenjska regional museum.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="3" width="100%">   <tbody><tr>     <td width="45%"><span class="dariah_link_button"><a href="http://localhost:8666/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=85">&lt;&lt; 4.
