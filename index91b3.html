<div class="article-content">
<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">The term ‘digital humanities’ is not widely known in Slovenia, and is rarely used among researchers. Nevertheless, 				national resolutions, strategies and action documents show that digitisation is seen as a priority, so this is the focus of much of 				the infrastructural development to date. The objective of the strategies from the government and ministerial departments is to 				provide easy public access via the internet to the cultural heritage of the nation.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn1" href="#ftn1" title="body_ftn1">1</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> Documents follow the recommendations and actual requirements of the European Commission. The ministries (Ministry of 				Culture and Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology) and the Slovenian Research Agency publish calls for applications 				related to the research infrastructure in general, or general declarations of support for the development of cultural heritage 				digitisation. In addition to access, preservation is cited as the most common imperative for the digitisation of cultural heritage 				in documents and strategies. The development of research infrastructure in humanities is not treated separately, but incorporated 				into the field of cultural heritage and programmes of research infrastructure. The digitisation process appears aimed at the general 				population, not towards the research and scientific communities.</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Despite this vision and these stated priorities, Slovenia is lacking a clear strategy for the development of digitisation 			that would provide guidelines to individual research institutes, and others already involved in this process. Digital centres in 			Slovenia process a variety of content on an ad hoc basis, but without a common policy that would point towards the systematic 			digitisation of this material. This case study demonstrates that the current state of digitisation of the research infrastructure in 			humanities is rather scattered and disorganised. This lack of a proper policy results in a duplication of documents digitised in 			various centres. </p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="1_1__Methodology" title="1_1__Methodology"></a> 			<span>1.1.</span> 		Methodology</h2> 		<p class="P6">The conclusions of this case study are based on a study of documents, online discussions, conversations with individuals, 			and our own experience in the field of Slovene historiography research infrastructure. Due to the lack of documents which would 			indicate coherent development strategies for the digitisation of the humanities-related research infrastructure, we decided to conduct 			interviews with individuals. These were aimed at identifying individual initiatives as well as monitoring the communication dynamics 			between various centres and individuals in the area of a digital humanities infrastructure. </p> 		<p class="P6">The interviews were conducted at the Directorate for the Information Society at the Ministry of Higher Education, Science 			and Technology; the Slovenian Research Agency – who are responsible for research infrastructure; the Josef Stefan Institute – for the 			development of language technologies;  dLib (National University Library); the Ministry of Culture; and the Central Library in 			Maribor. Individuals interviewed are not a representative sample – and this was not our intention – but the data gathered can still 			provide a basis for a general assessment of the current status, activities and development over recent years.</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="1_2__Agencies_and_Responsibilities" title="1_2__Agencies_and_Responsibilities"></a> 			<span>1.2.</span> 		Agencies and Responsibilities</h2> 		<p class="P6">The development of policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology (MVZT), 			through the policies and programmes of its Directorate of the Information Society; the ARRS (Slovenian Research Agency - a national funding body) and the MK (Ministry of Culture). The task of the Directorate of the Information Society at the MVZT is to establish and 			design the technological infrastructure, whilst that of the MK is to determine content, with the Ministry looking particularly at 			cultural heritage. The main problem is that the focus is on actual content, whilst not enough attention is paid to the issues of open 			access and presentation. </p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">In 1994, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia has established an information service for Slovene science, 				culture and education – the Institute of Information Science (</span> 			<a href="http://www.izum.si/"> 				<span class="Internet_20_link"> 					<span class="T4">IZUM</span> 				</span> 			</a> 			<span class="T4">).</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn2" href="#ftn2" title="body_ftn2">2</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> Together with other key players within the information services in the country, IZUM enables Slovenia's inclusion 				into the information highways of the contemporary world. IZUM's objectives, closely related to the research infrastructure for 				humanities, encompass the following: the development of mutual bibliographic systems and the coordination of cataloguing in 				cooperation with the National Library; the organisation and maintenance of information systems to monitor research activity in 				Slovenia; engineering related to the development and maintenance of the computers and communication infrastructure in the 				educational, research and cultural organisations; research, development and consultancy work in one's own field of activity. IZUM's 				activity is particularly related to the development and operation of the COBISS system and its services.</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">IZUM plays an important role among the researchers in arts and humanities. In cooperation with the Slovenian Research 			Agency – it established science research infrastructure providing information on research programmes, projects, researchers and 			research institutions– the SICRIS information system – which includes 765 research organisations, 1,238 research groups, 12,818 			researchers, 4,921 research projects , and 600 research programmes. SICRIS also allows viewing of the presentation pages of European 			Projects of the EU Framework Programmes, directly from the Projects Database within the CORDIS system.</p>  <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="3" width="100%"> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td width="45%"> 					<span class="dariah_link_button"> 						<a href="http://www.dariah.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=85">&lt;&lt; Outline</a> 					</span> 				</td> 				<td> </td> 				<td width="45%" align="right"> 					<span class="dariah_link_button"> 						<a href="http://localhost:8666/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=85">2.

In 	1991, the Ministry of Science and Technology defines IZUM as the information infrastructure service for science, education and 	culture in Slovenia and in 1994 the Government of the Republic of Slovenia passes the complemented IZUM Foundation Act, by which it 	determines its functions.</span></p>
