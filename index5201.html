<font size="2"><strong>Visual Tools and Methods in Digital Humanities: Representing, Reading, and Thinking about Knowledge Creation...<br /> 21st of July 2012 in Hamburg alongside the DH conference.</strong><br /> <br /> Exploring the shifting intersection between more descriptive and  analytical uses of visual components in digital environments and  interpretative research tools - we will theorize 'new' readings and  question shifts in representation within the digital sphere. The  barriers between more descriptive and more analytical approaches are  also constantly shifting as researchers become more and more acquainted  with formulating research needs in a digital context, but also as a  result of technologies becoming increasingly user-friendly and hence  inviting collaboration between specialists and non-specialists within  the same context. The workshop’s general aim will be to define critical  reading principles both for research itself but also for creating  digital tools for different aspects of the research process. We will aim  at understanding how different research questions can arise from these  methods in terms of open data, collaboration, remediation, place, space  and performance, impact and outreach. We invite teams of researchers and  developers where knowledge of information visualization is  used as a  key component of their work. We encourage participants to elaborate on  the tensions and added-values when working across disciplines - both  humanities and information sciences. Contributions should contain well  defined technical and scholarly research considerations. The synergy  effect of working together needs to be well defined. Objectives: - To  create an understanding of why visualization is used, to what end? - How  does the visualization relate to the theoretical orientation of the  research? - To critically analyze the impact of the methods for  visualization both in terms of finding new knowledge as well as better  communicating the result of research.-To investigate how digital visual  methods can be utilized to support unanticipated research questions. -   Collaborative work for explorative methods and research with structured  datasets (complex or simple, large or small)<br /> Duration of the workshop<br /> The workshop is intended to be for 1 day, 8.30 - 4.30 on the 21st of July 2012 in Hamburg alongside the DH conference.<br /> <br /> Dates and submission:<br /> Participants are expected to contribute with a short paper of max 1,000  words describing their contributions. The deadline for the submission  will be the 13th of April and notification to accepted contributors will  be  by the 23rd April. Successful contributors will have their travel  and accommodation funded by NeDiMAH .<br /> <br /> Target audience (12-15 participants)<br /> Examples could be:<br /> Travel narratives - linguistic research<br /> Textual analysis<br /> Network Analysis<br /> Internet Culture Studies<br /> Archaeology, Environmental and Site Reconstructions<br /> Historical Narratives and Cultural Heritage Studies<br /> Illustration/Visual Art Research Exhibitions<br /> Urban History<br /> Population Studies<br /> Place Name & Culture Studies<br /> <br /> Program committee :<br /> 1.       Fredrik Palm, HUMlab, Umeå University<br /> 2.       Stuart Dunn (DARIAH), Kings College London<br /> 3.       Simon Lindgren, Professor in Sociology Umeå University<br /> 4.       Orla Murphy, University College Cork o.murphy@ucc.ie<br /> <br /> The workshop is part of the NEDIMAH-network. The NeDiMAH Network will  examine the practice of, and evidence for, advanced ICT methods in the  arts and humanities across Europe, and articulate these findings in a  series of outputs and publications. To accomplish this, NeDiMAH will  provide a locus of networking and interdisciplinary exchange of  expertise among the trans-European community of digital arts and  humanities researchers, as well as those engaged with creating and  curating scholarly and cultural heritage digital collections. NeDiMAH  will maximise the value of national and international e-research  infrastructure initiatives by developing a methodological layer that  allows arts and humanities researchers to develop, refine and share  research methods that allow them to create and make best use of digital  methods and collections. Better contextualization of ICT Methods will  also build human capacity, and be of particular benefit for early stage  researchers.</font></div>
