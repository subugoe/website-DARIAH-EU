Researchers in KNAW institutes collaborate with universities in order to develop innovative tools and theories for understanding what computational approaches can mean for research and scholarship in the humanities and social sciences.<br /><br />The Group has two strands which will be integrated intellectually, physically and organisationally over the course of the five-year programme (2011-2015). The first strand focuses on Computational Humanities in which technical experts will work together with scholars in the humanities in order to develop new tools, methods, and approaches for gathering, storing, processing, documenting and representing data (including text, numbers, images and sounds). The second strand examines Cultures of e-Humanities by exploring what such new developments mean for the ways in which those engaged in the humanities and social sciences conduct their research, including questions around new research questions and methods, interdisciplinary and international collaboration, and novel forms of output and dissemination.</p><p><strong>Applications for 2013 now open!</strong></p>

 <p>These visiting fellowships are intended to enable scholars working in  computational humanities to conduct research and to participate in the  academic life of the eHumanities Group of the KNAW. Visiting fellowships  are awarded for three months</p> <p>Preference will be given to candidates who can demonstrate an ability  to contribute to one of the ongoing projects of the Computational  Humanities Programme (see website for details). During their stay,  fellows will be expected to make one presentation about their own  research and to hold one workshop in which they provide training in a  particular tool, method or approach.</p> <p>Applicants should send their CV plus a two-page plan for their fellowship to Jeannette Haagsma (<a href="mailto:jeannette.haagsma@ehumanities.knaw.nl">jeannette.haagsma@ehumanities.knaw.nl</a>)  by 01 November 2012. The plan should include which 3 months they would  like to spend in Amsterdam (excluding July & August), and ideas for  the presentation and workshop. Visiting fellowships are open to women  and men from all countries who already have a PhD and a demonstrable  record in computational humanities. Successful applicants will receive a  stipendium of â‚¬10,000 (paid in three instalments) plus the costs of one  return journey from their home. Fellows will be expected to make their  own tax, visa, insurance and accommodation arrangements, where  necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
