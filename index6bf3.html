<p><img src="http://localhost:8666/images/stories/ie_mou.JPG" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p><p>Following the recent DARIAH Management board meeting at Trinity College Dublin on Friday October 1st, 2010, the director of the <a href="http://www.irchss.ie/">Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences</a> (IRCHSS), Dipti Pandya,Â  signed the DARIAH Memorandum of understanding (MoU), expressing full support of the DARIAH project and its future both in Ireland and across Europe.<br /><br />The MoU helps lay the path towards the construction of DARIAH under the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=eric">European Research Infrastructures Consortium</a> Framework (ERIC).<br /><br />In addition to IRCHSS director Pandya, Jane Ohlmeyer (IRCHSS/Trinity College Dublin) and Maria O'Brien (IRCHSS) were also on hand for the signing ceremony, which was attended by representatives from the university sector, the Irish research and IT sectors, along with members of the DARIAH management board.<br /><br />Professor Ohlmeyer had this to say about the MoU signing: "This is an important moment for the continuing development and enhancement of the digital humanities in Ireland. We believe strongly in the potential of DARIAH for enabling and supporting research."<br /><br />Such sentiments were echoed by DJ McCloskey from <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/textanalytics/infocenter.html">IBM Ireland's LanguageWare Group</a>: "We love what's happening in the digital humanities right now. The overlap between what IBM is doing and what DARIAH is doing points the way to fascinating future collaborations". These could include wider application of tools developed for natural language processing, said McCloskey.<br /><br />Representatives of the FP7 Cultura project were also on hand. Dr. Owen Conlan, of Trinity College's School of Computer Science and Statistics, a partner in Cultura, underlined the importance of personalisation, social networking analysis and community building for leveraging the engagement of users with all manner of digital humanities artefacts and collections. "Computer Science and Humanities research complement each other very well" said Dr. Conlan, pointing to the interplay between each and how they serve to "push each other to constantly innovate and develop."<br /><br />DARIAH will hold it's <a href="http://www.dariah.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=135&amp;Itemid=197">final conference in Vienna, October 19-21, 2010</a>. </p>
