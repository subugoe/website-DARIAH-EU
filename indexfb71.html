Special emphasis is placed on the regeneration and renewal of the infrastructure of classical studies through the systematic collection and editing in computerized databases of source materials, including literary texts, inscriptions and coins, photographs, plans, maps, aerial photographs and topographical diagrams. Equally important is the publication of these materials in collections ('corpora'), the production of monographs, articles and other studies based on the data collected. The training of young scholars and the development of collaborative research programmes with Greek and foreign scholars, foundations and organizations is highly promoted through scholarly exchanges and the organization of conferences. The European Union has also funded the progressive establishment of a computer network and the production of programmes, which have facilitated the transfer of archives into electronic format, and the application of technology to the Institute's research and publishing activities.
