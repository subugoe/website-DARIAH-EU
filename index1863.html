<div class="article-content">
<p class="P6">‘Digital humanities’ remains an unfamiliar term, rarely used among the researchers or in public and when it is, usually 			relates to the electronic publication of scientific articles. Even in the more advanced areas of digital development, interviews 			reveal very different understandings of the term ‘digitisation’. One researcher engaged in language technologies believes the problem 			is lack of communication between ICT professionals and humanists. Not only do these two groups lack good inter-communication, but this 			is also difficult to establish due to the diversity of their many differing terminologies and methodologies and divergent views on the 			open access of documents. </p> 		<p class="P6">As to the resolutions and strategies of the Republic of Slovenia that are related to the humanities, we want to 			particularly mention the digitisation of libraries (books and periodicals) and archival material. The current activities in Slovenia 			(mainly in libraries and to a smaller extent in different institutions) are oriented towards the digitisation of books and 			periodicals, whereas other material (archival, visual material) is left aside, despite the fact that archives already partially 			digitalise their own material. With the exception of strategies adopted by the digital library (dLib), the digitisation of library 			material does not share a coherent development policy, and the digitisation of archival material is generally rather loose and lacks a 			uniform concept. Due to the increasing interest by the public and researchers (scientists) in this archival material, it is one of the 			major priorities of the public archive service to provide open access to it. As a matter of fact, not much has been accomplished in 			this field and the public only has limited access to the archive depots.</p> 		<p class="P6">The interviews indicate dispersion, confusion, vague concepts of competence and definitions of terms created by various 			individuals, which may have serious consequences. For example, the director of dLib drew attention to the problematic understanding of 			digitisation, which in the MK's view, only encompassed the actual scanning process, which was eligible for funding whereas other 			related processes (e.g. access to scanned documents, construction of depositories and metadata processing) were excluded. This 			gradually changed – most likely through the initiative and negotiations of the individuals involved in dLib – in the call on 			applications for the MK funding programme for dLib. Nevertheless, MK projects applied for by individual smaller libraries still 			encompass only the scanning stage. The libraries are expected to apply for additional funding for the implementation of metadata, 			organisation and processing. Now access and metadata processing is provided by dLib which is itself interested in a coordinated 			process. Unfortunately, it often happened in the past that scanned documents were just left in drawers. We have not discovered any 			other initiatives that might result in new policies, or any actual concerted pressure being brought to bear upon ministries and 			national funding bodies. </p> 		<p class="P6">Digital research centres in humanities have developed within the programmes of research infrastructure. The connections 			with support centres – libraries and archives (funded by various ARRS programmes and MK programmes) – are facilitated by the 			researchers' use of their services. The digitisation of humanities is dealt with by various centres in Slovenia (Faculty departments 			within the Universities of Ljubljana, Maribor and Koper), SAZU (Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts), the National University 			Library, local studies departments of other Slovene libraries (for example Central Library, Celje), IZUM, the Scientific Research 			Centre in Koper, etc. These digital centres differ from each other: they can be online portals of institutions or a digital service 			for internal users, whereas in a few examples, they provide access to digitised publications, documents and other material for the 			general public – in particular the presentation of publications (table of contents and abstracts), other databases and similar.</p> 		<p class="P6">Online discussions and interviews point to some individual digitization initiatives in the field of research or cultural 			heritage which result in separate projects (most often not related to each other), whereas the national resolutions and strategies in 			their initiatives and explanations mainly refer to the European Commission documents.</p> 		<p class="P6">In the view of the majority of the people interviewed, the initiatives and individual cooperation between various 			institutions can only be realised within the European projects, due also to their greater funding. This also holds true for dLib, 			although we should not underestimate the initiatives from Slovenia within individual projects. The problem is lack of information 			about structural funds. The public is still not familiar with all the possibilities of drawing funds from the EU, thus the issue of 			international cooperation still remains at a basic stage, and requires more thorough consideration in the future.</p> 		<p class="P6">As shown by the experience of the central national centre – the digital library – the actual strategies (the dLib 			strategy) mainly originate from individuals' own initiatives which resulted in collaborative projects and collaborations, and 			subsequent modifications were made to calls for applications. No such steps were made in the field of science (in particular 			humanities).</p> 		<p class="P6">Specific projects and collaborations between centres tend to be the result of previous cooperation between individuals or 			institutions. For example, the MK covers an area too large to be able to focus on individual strategies. Recorded priorities are 			designed upon the EC example. In the field of cultural heritage, the MK pays more attention to the National University Library (NUK), 			dLib and the register of movable and immovable heritage (which nevertheless fails to deliver actual results in the field of 			digitisation). In this respect, the science is only treated indirectly.</p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">According to online discussions and conversations with individuals, there is a lot of talking about the significance 				of cultural heritage, but a lack of actual decisive action that could bring changes in the human resources policy as well as a shift 				in funding priorities. The lack of a development strategy can also be attributed to the shortage of political will. Slovenia is 				believed to have failed establishing a synergy between the ministries of culture, education, science and technology during its 				independence (after 1991),</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn7" href="#ftn7" title="body_ftn7">7</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> which has had a negative effect in the interdisciplinary fields, such as the preservation of cultural 				heritage.</span> 		</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="3_3__Public_Private_Cooperation_in_Digital_Research_Infrastructures" title="3_3__Public_Private_Cooperation_in_Digital_Research_Infrastructures"></a> 				<span>3.3.</span> 			Public/Private Cooperation in Digital Research Infrastructures</h2> 		<p class="P6">There is no real cooperation between public and private in the digital research infrastructure in Slovenia. Within 			state-funded projects (through Slovene Research Agency), a number of research centres sign contracts with private individuals to 			digitize materials, process metadata and organize it. The role of research and educational institutions as well as libraries is to 			define the content and connection modes of the material. A number of research centres make contracts with private individuals within 			by the state funded projects, private individuals digitize them, then process metadata and organize it. This is financed by the 			Slovenian Research Agency, whereas research institutions, educational institutions and libraries define the content and connection 			modes of the material. Only occasionally also private individuals (ICT centres) apply for projects. This cooperation depends on a 			case-by-case basis.</p> 		<p class="P6">Building upon the initiative of the private company Digitalizacija d.o.o. who specialised in the digitisation of movable 			and immovable cultural heritage after 2005, one of the first conferences on the digitisation of cultural heritage was organised in 			2007, with the participation of the Ministry of Culture. </p> 		<p class="P6">One major criticism directed at researchers is that they lock files away and prevent further processing and work with the 			metadata. The communication between humanists and ICT professionals still needs to be developed in Slovenia, with the establishment of 			digital humanities and its incorporation into university programmes (possibly at post-graduate level).</p> 		<p class="P6">In Slovenia, there is no (central) repository for humanities. Individual institutions and editorial boards have their own 			online presentations, which rather than complete publications introduce cover pages with table of contents.</p> 		<ul> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">In the 					view of the Ministries and funding bodies, Slovenia is too small for a central repository; </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Some 					wonder who would take this role; </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Such a 					repository is needed, not on the same server, but at the level of metadata;  </p> 			</li> 		</ul> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">Links between ICT professionals and humanists are established in the area of language technologies and electronic 				scientific publications, though this more or less depends on the initiative of individuals (eZiss – Scholarly digital edition of 				Slovene literature).</span> 			<span class="T4"> 				<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 					<a name="body_ftn8" href="#ftn8" title="body_ftn8">8</a> 				</span> 			</span> 		</p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">There are initiatives to form discussions on scientific publications and digital humanities in relation to the 				Slovene language, based on the actual project of the eZiss web centre. Attention was brought to the intertwining of information 				technologies and humanities, methods of science changing, a register of types of material, method of material analyses and its 				presentation.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn9" href="#ftn9" title="body_ftn9">9</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">The need for closer collaboration between researchers and the State (and thereby, increased financial support) also 			features in the conversations we had, as well as in the various contributions, online discussions etc.  Further to this, within the 			research infrastructure of Slovene historiography at the Institute of Contemporary History, we also believe in the significance of 			closer cooperation between research institutions. The result of this dispersed approach to the digitisation of humanities in Slovenia 			is duplication on one hand, and a lack of evidence of what has already been done, on the other.</p> 		<p class="P6">The issue of connections and cooperation between various institutions (research institutes, researchers, support centres 			and the State) was pointed out by many individuals (though fewer did so at the Ministries). The individual views varied: some 			attribute the non-cooperation to the disparate criteria and requirements of their own disciplines, whilst others found that good 			communication was not established due to the different terminologies and epistemologies used by the humanists and ICT professionals. </p> 		<p class="P6">The solution could therefore be in the development of digital humanities (also in the area of education) that would bridge 			these obstacles. Some believe that European projects provide more possibilities for collaboration; they are something of an »umbrella« 			that can facilitate the collaboration and participation of various institutions. A problem with European projects and funds is that 			they are still underexploited (due to a lack of a central management role etc.). On the other hand, individuals also draw attention to 			the issue of dispersion and insufficient organisation within the EU projects. In addition, in Slovenia there is no financial support 			from enterprises nor international or national sponsorships or donations. Researchers, and quite often also private individuals (ICT 			centres), depend on funding from national and international projects.</p> 		<p class="P6">The documents (although rarely) point to interactive, digital and hypertextual services and aspects that need to be 			considered, in particular legal aspects and regulations, copyrights in the digital world, provision of e-knowledge and e-skills, 			safety on the Internet, enforcement of customer protection, including the provision of privacy and confidentiality. Interoperability 			and the use of open standards are evermore becoming a clear requirement and condition for any further successful development. In terms 			of access, the significance of speech and other user interface technologies is increasing, for example W3C WAI (Web Accessibility 			Initiative), which allow access to e-content by various groups of people that are physically impaired.</p> 		<p class="P6">In addition to the legal aspect, often brought up in conversations, there are also other issues, such as:</p> 		<ul> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Open 					access: the fear of theft and locking of documents. </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Copyright; 						 </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">In the 					view of the Ministries, one of the important issues is that individuals insist on keeping documents in various formats (digital, 					printed, micro film, etc.) with resulting cost increases; </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Does it 					make sense to establish central national digital centres? Various interlocutors also refer to differing definitions of what 					constitutes a ‘digital centre’. The question also arises of what such a centre is supposed to offer – given the fact that digital 					humanities in Slovenia have not developed yet, and in fact this issue is not even discussed. The only centre of national 					significance with a developed strategy in the country is the digital library: </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">The 					necessity of common standards of reference so that the web services are aware of its existence; </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">The 					different criteria and standards used across various disciplines (in humanities) and within culture (museums, archives etc.) might 					be a problem. </p> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P21">&nbsp;</p> 			</li> 		</ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="3" width="100%">   <tbody><tr>     <td width="45%"><span class="dariah_link_button"><a href="index72e7.html?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=85">&lt;&lt; 2.
