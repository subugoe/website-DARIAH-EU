The summer schools are being funded by the  European Union.</p> <p>The first EHRI summer school will be organized by the Shoah Memorial –  Museum, Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation, Paris, France  between 15 July and 2 August 2013. The second EHRI summer school will be  organized by the Institute of Contemporary History Munich – Berlin in  Munich, Germany between 22 July and 9 August 2013. The main language of  communication during the summer schools will be English, but passive  comprehension of French (in Paris) or German (in Munich) will also be  required.</p> <p>The summer schools will provide an overview on methods, sources and  the state of research in Holocaust history research and will be aimed at  the graduate level. The summer schools will be open to scholars from a  variety of disciplines (historians, sociologists, psychologists,  anthropologists and others interested in the Holocaust) as well as  archivists. Candidates from Central and Eastern Europe are especially  encouraged to apply. The 12 places in each summer school will be awarded  on a competitive basis.</p> <p>EHRI will cover travel and subsistence costs during the summer  school. Recipients are responsible for securing visas if necessary. In  2013, there will be another call for applications for the two EHRI  summer schools scheduled to take place in 2014 in Amsterdam and  Jerusalem. All four summer schools will share a similar curriculum with  topics such as the role of the German elites and general population in  the Holocaust, recent developments in the historiography of the ghettos  and camps as well as the involvement in and reactions of the local  population to the Holocaust in both Western and Eastern Europe. Visits  to memorial sites, research libraries and archives will also be  included.</p> <p>All application materials must be submitted in English. The application must include the following: </p> <ul><li>A completed application form;</li><li>A curriculum vitae (maximum 2 pages) including 3-5 indicative publications, if any; </li><li>A cover letter telling us why you want to participate in the program  and what you think you can gain for your own project(s) by taking part  (maximum 2 pages);</li><li>A letter of recommendation from a reputable academic who is familiar  with the applicant’s work. A letter of recommendation should include  evaluation of the overall quality of the applicant’s work. The letter  may be sent by email as a scan (including the recommender's signature  and letterhead) with the application or directly by the recommender. The  letter must be received before the application deadline;</li><li>Applicants must also designate a second recommender in the application form. The recommender may be contacted directly by EHRI. </li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All application material can be sent as an email attachment in DOC or PDF format to <a href="mailto:bennett@ifz-muenchen.de">bennett@ifz-muenchen.de</a>.
