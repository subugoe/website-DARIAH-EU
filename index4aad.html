In at least three participating countries – the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark – it is likely that DARIAH will be incorporated in the national Roadmaps for Research Infrastructures, the priority listings as established by the Ministries of Science. <br /><br />This became apparent at the DARIAH kick-off meeting in late October in The Hague. The good news clearly contributed to the general confidence in the outcome of the ‘Preparing DARIAH’ process, a confidence which was already considerable at the start.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.dariah.eu/images/stories/logos/dariah/logo_b_2.gif" border="0" alt="DARIAH logo" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />Representatives of data institutes from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the Netherlands and Cyprus, among others, discussed possibilities to make circumstances as favorable as possible for the ‘Building DARIAH’ phase of the project, which is supposed to start in 2010. On behalf of the European Commission, representatives were addressed by Mrs. Maria Carvalho Dias, speaking on behalf of the Research Infrastructures Unit within the Directorate-General Research of the European Commission. Carvalho Dias stipulated that the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the data infrastructure that DARIAH aims to realize.<br /><br />Carvalho Dias had several recommendations toward enhancement of opportunities for success in the final submission of the ‘Building DARIAH’ proposal. The current project, ‘Preparing DARIAH,’ was put in motion to lay the ground work for this next phase. Ultimately, the size of the ‘Building DARIAH’ project is estimated at some 6 million euros annually.<br /><br />In the field of research methods and tools, a considerable yield is expected from DARIAH. The project will not only enable the development of new methods and tools, but will also work towards their exchange and dissemination among researches in all participating countries. In this way, researchers can take advantage of progress that is realized in one country.<br />
