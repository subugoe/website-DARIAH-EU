<p>DH in Germany, Austria and Switzerland is surely  “alive and kicking”, as a multitude of DH projects as well as funding  programs by, among other, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) and the  Volkswagenstiftung  demonstrate – but DH scholars in this region still lack a representative  organization that would formulate our field’s academic interests and  requirements and communicate these to regional research policy makers  and funding agencies, as well as to the broader public.</p> <p>In order to facilitate future strategic development of DH as a leading future research paradigm, the DHD invites all academic DH researchers in the German speaking region to come together, exchange ideas and information and establish a joint professional organization called "Digital Humanities Deutschland (DHD)". The DHD is intended as a chapter organization within the European ALLC (Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing).</p> <p>The formation of the DHD combines three elements:</p> <ul><li>an initial project fair as a platform for the informal presentation  of current undertakings in the Digital Humanities, with a particular  focus on projects lead by of junior researchers;</li><li>the subsequent founding of a German regional association DHD as a regional chapter of ALLC;</li><li>an expert panel discussion that will explore strategic issues of  relevance to the emerging Digital Humanities community in the German  speaking countries.</li></ul> <p>The format of the inaugural meeting will be that of a so-called un-conference. This meeting will be held at the University of Hamburg on 17 July 2012   in conjunction with the DH 2012 and will conclude immediately prior to  its opening.  (The registration procedure will be coordinated with that  for the DH 2012.)</p> To receive updates on this initiative, please subscribe to the DH 2012 mailing list and earmark the new DHD web address <a href="http://www.dig-hum.de/">http://www.dig-hum.de</a> which will go live soon.
