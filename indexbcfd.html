<p>At <a href="http://www.mith2.umd.edu/dh09/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities 2009</a>, held from the 22nd to the 25th of June at the University of Maryland, representatives of several major infrastructure projects came together on a panel entitled ‘Supporting the Digital Humanities: putting the jigsaw together’. The projects were represented by Seth Denbo (DARIAH), Neil Fraistat (CenterNet), Chad Kainz (Bamboo), and Steven Krauwer (CLARIN); Martin Wynne, who is the official liaison between DARIAH and CLARIN chaired the panel. All of these projects are in the planning stages, so it was very useful to compare and contrast strategy and policy, and valuable have the opportunity to present the plans to the digital humanities community. </p><p>Three crucial points came out of the papers and discussion. First, it was widely agreed that infrastructure must support the way researchers work and therefore should be built with the input and ongoing involvement of the community. Second, because of the need to respond to the community, infrastructure initiatives should build on and enhance existing resources, rather than attempting to start from scratch. Finally, all of the speakers emphasized that infrastructure is not just about technology, it is about people and communities, information, knowledge, epistemic practices, content, data, etc. The panel led to some very useful discussion (including input via Twitter) about the importance of  large-scale infrastructure projects. Overall it was a valuable opportunity to exhange ideas and discuss plans.<br /><br />Shortly after the panel Seth Denbo, who had represented DARIAH, was interviewed briefly by one of the organizers about what he felt was the most interesting aspect of the conference. His reponse, which emphasized the need for a coordinated infrastructure <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddN9mbxJxCU" target="_blank">can been seen here</a>, along side other <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dh09conf" target="_blank">Digital Humanities 2009 Speed Interviews</a>.</p><p>A live blog of the Digital Humanities 2009 conference is available on <a href="http://www.arts-humanities.net/forumtopic/discussing_digital_humanities_09" target="_blank">arts-humanities.net</a>.</p></div>
