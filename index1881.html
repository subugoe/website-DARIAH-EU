<p lang="en-GB">One of the main issues that concerned both the survey participants and the surveyors in the desk research was the government strategy on digital research. The survey's systematic and documented character permitted a rather objective and reliable evaluation. The question on how well prepared humanities research in Greece is to respond to the present demands of scholarship on a national and international level was answered in a reasonably reliable manner. Besides, the survey resulted in the compilation of a list of prospective key DARIAH stakeholders and of the particular organizations declaring their willingness to participate in the DARIAH initiatives and specifying the manner in which they wish to do so.</p>
<p>The questionnaire addressed to the Greek institutes and broader research community yielded revealing results. A measurable optimism is expressed regarding the comparison to the other European countries with respect to digital research. Either characterized as "good" or "moderate", the status of digital scholarship in Greece presumably can support a series of initiatives towards an organized system both in research and in teaching. Similarly, when it comes to readiness of the bodies to support and conduct digital scholarship, the prevailing percentage stated they are qualified to do so. Since most of the stakeholders have already taken part in a number of digitization projects over the last years, they feel quite confident with the experience they have gained. Besides, half of them declare that they actually provide services to cope with the needs of digital scholars, which may mean that they provide either access to their digitized content or other tools like thesauri, technical facilities and infrastructures. Consequently, the willingness to contribute to the DARIAH initiative comes as a natural manifestation of their interest in digital humanities. The predefined selection of choices that the survey offered transformed the general intention into a set of specific actions these organizations are invited to contribute to. Providing content access is by far the most popular option, while collaborating to build user requirements needs is the second most favoured option, a fact that is of great value and usefulness for the present needs of Preparing DARIAH. Sharing tools, methodology and providing digital curation services are also popular options among interviewees.</p>
<p>However promising the results of the questionnaire regarding the attitude of the organizations and their willingness to proceed with policies that favor collaboration and boost awareness, there are still big obstacles to overcome and coordination of efforts is of most critical importance. The lack of major data repositories and a national depository is a significant gap that is attributed to the lack of a national strategy to establish a digital infrastructure. There is also no national policy to guide and develop digital scholarship in the arts and humanities. As Greek digital humanities overcomes its lack of a digital infrastructure, it will be called upon to deal with issues such as interoperability, copyright and cooperation between institutions.</p>
<p>In brief, the survey pinpoints lack of funding and limited coordination as the basic obstacles to progress in this. On the other hand, thanks to the first large-scale digitization initiative funded by the "Information Society" Operational Programme, a very important mentality barrier is being gradually overcome: Research institutions, universities, museums and the research community no longer underestimate the value of communicating knowledge. Communities of researchers with common research interests are expanding with the use of websites and blogs and new networks are coming into existence. It is true that limited communication among organizations has often resulted in overlaps and duplication of research projects. This is gradually changing. What is equally important, the outdated structure of state agencies and cultural organizations and the slow adaptation of the educational and training system to the requirements of a new knowledge environment, which had encumbered progress both in teaching and research, are being modernized. Humanities are overcoming their traditional conservative approach to research, fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing and experimentation with new research methods and questions. To site a characteristic comment by one of the interviewees: "We are looking for cooperation for the digital custody of our collections, so that we can offer it effectively to the research community. We hope this survey will bring us in touch with other institutions and that we may cooperate on this subject."</p>
<p lang="en-GB">DARIAH on the other hand is eager to communicate a vision to prospective partners and stakeholders and to invite them to join the effort of building the European digital infrastructure. It is, of course, absolutely understandable that many researchers in the humanities remain hesitant as to the benefits of computational techniques and therefore, reluctant to invest a significant amount of their time and energy to pursue&nbsp;what they consider an uncertain outcome. These concerns, also addressed in the questionnaire, should be taken into account, so that future efforts should focus on education and update of the researchers. Consequently, the creation of such a new national research environment, be it an infrastructure or a network, must focus on building relationships and collaborations in specific disciplines and disseminate the products of these collaborations. Equally, the arrangement of workshops on the application of specific technologies to research interests and scholarship could dispel the distrust and encourage the use of computational methodologies for these disciplines.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">In order for the digital humanities experiment to succeed, efforts in two directions are equally necessary: Firstly, to build capacity among the Greek humanistic research community by advocating the advantages of digital research over traditional methods. And secondly, to work upon policymakers in order to convince them to put DARIAH on the national roadmap and secure funding for the construction and implementation phases of the project. This target coincides with a call launched in the beginning of 2009 by the GSRT, whose aim is the establishment of research infrastructure networks related to ESFRI projects in which Greek research institutions are participating. These RI networks are being invited to produce feasibility studies on the value of each of the European RIs for Greece. These feasibility studies will enable the GSRT to evaluate the merits of each RI for the Greek research community and to decide which of these RIs will be on the national roadmap and receive funding into the next phase.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The two Greek DARIAH partners, the Academy of Athens and the DCU, R.C. Athena have invited six other institutions to form a digital humanities network under the name “Research Infrastructure Network for the Humanities” (DYAS). The eight partner institutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The Academy of     Athens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The Digital     Curation Unit, R.C. Athena</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The University of     Athens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The National     Research Foundation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The Foundation for     Research and Technology- Hellas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The Ministry of     Culture- Directorate of the National Archive of Monuments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The Athens School     of Fine Arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">The National     Technical University of Athens- School of Electrical &amp; Computer     Engineering, Computer Science Division- Image, Video and Multimedia     Systems Laboratory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">DYAS will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">provide a platform     for exchanging ideas, knowledge innovation and experimentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">help overcome     isolation of researchers and the duplication of research activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-GB">offer a     collaborative environment in which research institutions will be     able to enhance the quality of humanistic research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB">The network will elaborate a proposal for linking the network with the European infrastructure DARIAH and will engage in a number of dissemination and training activities.</p>
<p>The DYAS consortium aims to build a collaborative national platform for the coordination and dissemination of humanities research at the national level. One of its main targets is to bridge the efforts of institutions and to save efforts and funds by avoiding the duplication of research. At the same time it will set agreed standards to which to adhere. However, initiatives by institutions need government backing. A comprehensive national digitization strategy formulated by the Government at a national level is essential. The work is being done on the ground; it now requires the input of government to bring it together into a national policy and a Trusted Digital Repository.</p>
