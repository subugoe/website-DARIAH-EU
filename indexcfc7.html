As previously stated, more attention is paid to cultural heritage and therefore the listed 			documents also particularly refer to cultural policy.</p> 		<p class="P6">National programmes define policies in relation to the cohesion policies of the European Union, 2007-2013, as well as to 			the development policies of Slovenia, as per the Strategy of Development of Slovenia, 2007-2013. The programmes not included in these 			and other documents adopted at the national level, (such as the National Programme for the Development of Rural regions, 2007-2013 or 			the Operative Programme of the Regional Development Potentials Promotion, 2007-2013 and such similar) provide the basis for the 			incorporation of cultural projects in the European programme documents to obtain money from the European Union funds.</p> 		<p class="P6">The National Culture Programme is based on the adopted principles of cultural policy, according to the pertinent 			guidelines and areas, including the priority objectives and priorities attainable. The Resolution on the National Culture Programme 			(NPK 2003) refers to the Slovene language and its use and development as its first general priority. In terms of modernisation of 			library material by electronic editions in Slovene and the digitisation of library heritage, it draws attention to the chronic delay 			in the digitisation of Slovene texts and the design of original or translated software. The language issue is in particular addressed 			by the »umbrella« strategic document, the Strategy of Development of Slovenia (SRS, 2005), the actual implementation of which would 			require more specific and emphasised provisions.</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="9_3__Strategy_of_the_Republic_of_Slovenia_in_the_Information_Society__2003" title="9_3__Strategy_of_the_Republic_of_Slovenia_in_the_Information_Society__2003"></a> Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia in the Information Society, 2003</h2> 		<p class="P6">Congruent with the Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia in the Information Society, 2003 (adopted at the 8th session of 			the Government of RS, held on 13th February 2003, resolution No. 033-15/2003-1), the informatisation of culture is defined as a 			priority of cultural policy. Its objectives encompass the following: the open access to culture, access to comprehensive information 			on culture and provision of a better quality professional and scientific assessment of culture. The document places emphasis on 			technical, organisational and content-wise issues (new media, telecommunication services, European digital contents, e-commerce etc.), 			whereas there is no mention of the language of information and computer tools. </p> 		<h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a name="9_4__Resolution_on_the_National_Culture_Programme_2004–2007__ReNPK0407_" title="9_4__Resolution_on_the_National_Culture_Programme_2004–2007__ReNPK0407_"></a> <span class="T4">Resolution on the National </span>Culture<span class="T4"> Programme 2004–2007 (ReNPK0407)</span></h2> 		<p class="P6">These document priorities are National and University Library and electronic publications (gathering and storage of online 			publications and their access). The primary objective is the provision of initial allocations for the acquisition of information 			equipment and electronic material processing.</p> 		<p class="P6">Anticipated outcomes are as follows: preservation of electronically published heritage, support in the use of 			electronically published and digitised material for education and research purposes within the information society. The anticipated 			informatisation of culture as a general priority of cultural policy in the period 2004-2007 includes some measures that would result 			in a digital library. The said measures encompass the support for the archiving of online content relevant to Slovene culture, the 			digitisation of Slovene library heritage and its presence on the Internet, as well as the formation of a national culture portal.</p> 		<p class="P6">One of the priorities of the public archive service is to – in a most friendly and accessible manner – bring the 			information on archive material closer to the public, doing this whilst considering the limitations imposed by data protection 			requirements, and the further development of the public archive service informatisation by the introduction of previously adopted, but 			for various reasons, unorganised material, as well as the promotion of professional processing of adopted archive material and 			provision/formation of basic tools aimed at its use. </p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="9_5__Resolution_on_National_Research_and_Development_Programme__2006-2010__ReNRRP_" title="9_5__Resolution_on_National_Research_and_Development_Programme__2006-2010__ReNRRP_"></a> Resolution on National Research and Development Programme, 2006-2010 (ReNRRP)</h2> 		<p class="P6">This resolution refers to further coordinated digitisation and the provision of a digital sources archiving system. 			Otherwise, the national research and development programme pays little attention to digitisation and development strategies and is 			more oriented towards actual policy in culture (faculties, public institutes etc.). The national culture programme is more focused on 			digitisation.</p> 		<p class="P6">At the Directorate for Information Society at MZVT, this speech was addressed as the basic reference for the Directorate's 			operation and definition of its task. Its key points are the following: initiative of the digital library (associate of Co-operative 			Online Bibliographic System & Services) and SICRIS (Slovenian Current Research Information System) to access information on 			research activity, e-learning and lifelong learning, intellectual property and copyrights, preservation of cultural heritage 			(referring to museums, libraries, archives and audio-visual material) for cultural identity.</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="9_7__Si2010__Development_Strategy_for_the_Information_Society_in_the_Republic_of_Slovenia" title="9_7__Si2010__Development_Strategy_for_the_Information_Society_in_the_Republic_of_Slovenia"></a> Si2010: Development Strategy for the Information Society in the Republic of Slovenia</h2> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">This document is the key strategic guideline following the European initiative i2010, and is based upon national 				strategic documents of Slovenia's development strategy, the National development Programme, 2007-2013 and the Resolution on National 				Development Projects, 2007-2013. The aim is </span> 			<span class="T4">to define a national framework to promote the development of the information society in Slovenia by 2010 (set 				development guidelines).</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn17" href="#ftn17" title="body_ftn17">17</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Scientific and research infrastructures are defined as special educational and research communication networks, the 			»accelerator of innovations and progress,« as well as the basis for research and development work. The document refers to the 			formation of the European Research Agency (ERA) which provides researchers and development engineers in the European Union equal 			opportunities as to their cooperation with development and research programmes. The e-Europe initiative includes action programmes 			which anticipate priority construction of infrastructures that would allow scientists and researchers rapid access to the Internet. 			Special emphasis is given to the fact that these are national and cross-European networks which electronically connect scientific and 			research institutions, universities, science libraries, research centres and educational institutions. The progress in computer and 			information technology allows researchers the development of advanced working methods, which by way of high-performance connections, 			visualise their achievements, form virtual development teams, access to geographically dispersed databases, do distant tests and use 			processing potentials of distant tools and devices. Special emphasis is given to the technological formation of the Slovene network 			Arnes, which is incorporated in the European GEANT.</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="9_8__Development_Strategy_of_Digital_Library_of_Slovenia_-_dLib_si_2007-2010_" title="9_8__Development_Strategy_of_Digital_Library_of_Slovenia_-_dLib_si_2007-2010_"></a> Development Strategy of Digital Library of Slovenia - dLib.si 2007-2010 </h2> 		<p class="P6">According to its concept, the digital library is categorised within the sixth target area of the strategy, the so-called 			formation of digital contents in the field of culture, science and education, thereby preservation of cultural heritage and language. 			In outlining the status, this strategic documents establishes that »the information and (tele)communication infrastructure itself is 			insufficient in its condition, for increased and better use of the information society services,« and points out that »the lack of 			quality digital content in the administrative, commercial as well as cultural and artistic fields on the Slovene web is the main 			reason for impaired use of the Internet in the country.« The formation of a digital library is the best solution to increase the 			volume of digital content in Slovene language online, as well as an opportunity to provide access to online content from either 			workplace or home to researchers, students and the population in general.</p> 		<p class="P6">As the safe keeper of Slovene written cultural heritage, the national library is the most appropriate institution to 			implement the digital library project. The humanities are not separately listed in the initiatives and resolutions.</p> 		<p class="P6">Further on, the document points out that digitisation is becoming a new significant task of all national libraries in the 			European Union in the field of cultural heritage preservation and its access. Therefore the national library is somewhat a natural 			protagonist for activity aimed to provide access to Slovene cultural content online, as well as its preservation.</p> 		<p class="P6">The Digital library (dLib) vision encompasses the following:</p> 		<ul> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Provision 					of information sources, information and services for the development requirements of the information society and the promotion of 					social and economic development of Slovenia; </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Permanent 					preservation of Slovene cultural heritage in a digital format by the maintenance and development of a trust-worthy repository or 					digital archive;  </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Formation, 					development and management of digital collections in compliance with users' requirements, pertinent regulations and standards, as 					well as in cooperation with various strategic partners in the field of culture, science, education and commerce;    </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Provide 					the broadest, open access to digitised content, and the development of tools for their use; </p> 			</li> 			<li> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P20">Promotion 					of the digital library as an infrastructure for educational and scientific research processes, for lifelong learning and the 					democratisation of society by providing access to digital information for all users, regardless of who they are and from what 					location they want to access information.  </p> 				<p style="margin-left: 0cm" class="P21">&nbsp;</p> 			</li> 		</ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="3" width="100%">   <tbody><tr>     <td width="45%"><span class="dariah_link_button"><a href="http://www.dariah.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=78">&lt;&lt; 8.
