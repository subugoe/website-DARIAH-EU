The TEI has proven to be one of the great success stories in the Digital Humanities. It has emerged as the de facto standard for online critical scholarly editions as well as a format that promotes interoperability and exchange. This success has also prompted a new direction in TEI research: the development of infrastructure to support TEI scholarship, comprising workflows, support for collaborative encoding, distributed annotation. Â <br /><br />The editors of the Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative, the official journal of the TEI Consortium, are delighted to announce a call for papers for a special issue that focuses on TEI Infrastructures. For this issue, the guest editors (Tobias Blanke and Laurent Romary) welcome articles including:<br /><br />* Infrastructures dedicated to the support of TEI-based research<br />* Requirements from annotation practices in Digital Humanities using TEI<br />* TEI as an Infrastructure across domains<br />* Especially the role of the TEI in infrastructural initiatives in the humanities<br />* Especially the use of TEI in Infrastructures to support collaborative editing and crowd-sourced editions<br />* Dynamic presentation interfaces for TEI-encoded text<br />* The TEI as an architectural component within national or international infrastructures (such as DARIAH, Europeana, Project Bamboo, TextGrid,etc.)<br />* The TEI as an architectural component in commercial and scholarly digital publishing infrastructures<br />* The TEI as a component within digital curation infrastructures<br />* Material, political, social, legal, and technical differences between building TEI-enabled tools and building TEI-aware infrastructure<br /><br />Submissions are accepted in two categories: research articles of 5,000 to 7,000 words and shorter articles reflecting new research or new tools/services of 2000-4000 words. Both may include images and multimedia content. Author guidelines are available at<br /><a href="http://journal.tei-c.org/journal/about/submissions#authorGuidelines">http://journal.tei-c.org/journal/about/submissions#authorGuidelines</a><br /><br />The Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative, a peer-reviewed open-access publication hosted by Revues.org, is the official journal of the TEI Consortium. <br />Closing date for submissions to this issue is <strong>30 September 2012</strong> with publication expected Spring 2013.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please contact<br /><a href="mailto:journal-guest-editors-5@tei-c.org">journal-guest-editors-5@tei-c.org</a>.
