During the meeting, EU project officer Saracco provided information on the current status of the Preparing DARIAH proposal.  <p>Though nothing is official yet, it seems the invitation for the contract negotiations can be expected any time now. Important activities for the next few months will therefore be the preparation of a consortium agreement and improving the Preparing DARIAH proposal, taking into account the suggestions from the evaluators.</p> <p>One of these suggestions concerns the specification of user communities. For the Preparing DARIAH project, the broad DARIAH target audience will be narrowed down to a number of specific user communities. The focus will be on the specific user communities of the two demonstrators that will initially be integrated in DARIAH:<br /> •	ARENA, with the specific user community of data creators from the field of archaeology;<br /> • Manuscripta runica in the Arnamagnaean Collection, with the specific user community of data users from the field of history and text.</p> <p>Another suggestion from the evaluators concerns the technical aspects of the infrastructure; more details are required. To this end, the technical working group presented a new version of the work package description in which technologies to be used are described in more detail. </p> <p>The amount of co-financing to be expected from the EC is also important; the proposed maximum contribution is significantly less than the requested contribution. Partners will therefore look into possibilities to increase national funding.</p> Apart from the adjustments for the proposal, short term activities discussed include the preparation of a newsletter, upgrade of the website and the appointment of liaison officers that will form a link between DARIAH and relevant international (e-humanities) projects like CLARIN and ENRICH.
