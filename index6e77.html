<div class="content"><p><strong>Work package 2 – Dissemination</strong></p> <p>The general objective is to raise awareness of (potential) stakeholders and promote dialogue between them on project-related developments. This work package includes four interrelated types of activities:</p> <p><strong>1) Awareness-raising activities: </strong><br /> Awareness-raising activities aim to involve more organisations across Europe, in particular new member states. Such activities include:<br /> •	Contacting (potential) stakeholders and making them aware of DARIAH,<br /> • Organising presentations, poster sessions and workshops at relevant conferences, such as DRHA (Digital Resources in the Humanities and Arts) in the UK,<br /> •	Distributing a half yearly newsletter with information about DARIAH and related work, and<br /> •	Holding a major conference toward the end of the preparatory phase for DARIAH members and potential new members. </p> <p><strong>2) Transfer of knowledge with related projects: </strong><br /> Transfer of knowledge between work package teams and teams from other projects is the responsibility of “Liaison officers”. They will transfer knowledge to and from initiatives such as CESSDA, CLARIN, DRIVER, PLANETS, ENRICH and Digital Humanities. The Liaison officers are also responsible for recommendations on coordination with other international initiatives.</p> <p><strong>3) Website maintenance: </strong><br /> The DARIAH website needs to be maintained and regularly updated in order to ensure continuous accessibility to up-to-date information. </p> <p><strong>4) Dissemination plan for the construction and operational phase: </strong><br /> Using the results and experiences from the Preparing DARIAH dissemination activities, a plan for the dissemination activities during the construction and operational phases will be developed. The communication plan will become part of the business plan.</p> </div></div>
