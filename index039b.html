<h2 class="P15"><a name="2_1__Priorities_" title="2_1__Priorities_"></a> 				<span>2.1.</span> 			Priorities </h2> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">As previously mentioned, the priority for the Republic of Slovenia is the protection of cultural heritage and for 				lifelong learning, in the sense of ‘computers in every school and the establishment of cybercafés'.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn3" href="#ftn3" title="body_ftn3">3</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> This stage is now over and has been replaced by a new one which should provide technological platforms across 				Slovenia and ‘fill up cyberspace with e-content'. The establishment of a technological platform is one of the key objectives of the 				Directorate for The Information Society at MVZT, whereas the content is to be the responsibility of the MK.</span> 		</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="2_2__Research_infrastructure_" title="2_2__Research_infrastructure_"></a> 				<span>2.2.</span> 			Research infrastructure </h2> 		<p class="P6">The researchers who investigated the applied sciences and the relationship between science and information technology, 			particularly focused on the following issues: how science uses web services; with whom researchers most often communicate; how they 			take opportunities to find projects; the connections they make with other institutions internationally via information technology 			(research on the use of Internet; Competitiveness in Slovenia 2002-2006; some projects were done by Science Research Centre at the 			Faculty of Social Sciences). </p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">Between the late 1990s and immediately after 2000, using the model of the triple spiral, applied science researchers 				pointed out the significance and need for different forms of intermediary structures between scientists, the economy and the 				political and social system. The study on the formation of the scientific community in cyberspace</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn4" href="#ftn4" title="body_ftn4">4</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> was based on empirical research, and draws attention to the need for a closer collaboration between institutions (of 				various disciplines, although with an emphasis on the natural sciences) and the State.</span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Research infrastructure (including, but not exclusively and not necessarily, digital support for humanities; so humanities 			is not treated separately from other disciplines within the research infrastructure) is set as a priority for further development of 			scientific research policies. Research infrastructure is – like all research support – considered in a broad sense, and it could 			potentially relate to internal web-portal design and connections, or to office equipment.</p> 		<h2 class="P15"><a name="2_3__Open_access_" title="2_3__Open_access_"></a> 				<span>2.3.</span> 			Open access </h2> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">Compliant with the declared priorities of the Republic of Slovenia, most attention is given to keeping (preserving) 				the digital material and somewhat less emphasis is placed to the provision of open access.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn5" href="#ftn5" title="body_ftn5">5</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> The significance of digitisation, and the subsequent open access of cultural heritage, refers particularly to the 				marketing of the creative industries and to the tourist economy as well as the use of digital cultural content in education and 				lifelong learning. The development and accessibility of the said content is considered a basis for the recognition of Slovenia 				across the world, and at the same </span> 			<span class="T4">time, the science could pull Slovenia out of the economic crisis. Thus the funding body (ARRS) is optimistic and 				anticipates further support for the research infrastructure programmes. </span> 		</p> 		<p class="P6">Discussions at the workshop on research and development strategy and the potential of The National and University Library 			(within the TEL-ME-MOR project) held in 2005, indicate disappointment over the State's under-involvement, as well as demanding a 			better coordinated national policy and increased connections between researchers, scientists, support communities and the State.</p> 		<p class="Standard"> 			<span class="T4">The same issue was brought up at the conference on material digitisation, held in 2007, organised by the private 				sector –Digitalizacija d.o.o.</span> 			<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"> 				<span class="T4"> 					<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"> 						<a name="body_ftn6" href="#ftn6" title="body_ftn6">6</a> 					</span> 				</span> 			</span> 			<span class="T4"> Namely, the digitisation of analogue content faces several difficulties, such as the shortage of funding, 				technological problems (data organisation and its access) as well as copyright issues. In addition, problems also arise in the 				digitisation process itself: what to digitise, and in what order? Priorities are determined by the money available instead of being 				based upon an agreement reached at national level. More attention should also be paid to the marketing of digital content. According 				to the technical director of Digitalizacija d.o.o, material digitisation faces another problem: there is no central register of 				content awaiting digitisation and of content already processed. This requires that the digitised content be stored in an organised 				and clear fashion, and as soon as possible, otherwise there's no point in the digitisation. </span> 		</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="3" width="100%">   <tbody><tr>     <td width="45%"><span class="dariah_link_button"><a href="http://localhost:8666/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=80">&lt; 1.
