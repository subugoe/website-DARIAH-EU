<div class="content"><p><strong>Work package 3 – Strategic Work</strong></p> <p>The general objective is to determine the strategic vision, goals, objectives and policies for DARIAH and to ensure they are based upon stakeholder requirements, business community and benefits for research. There are six major activities:</p> <p><strong>1) Investigate the current status and activities in EU member states:</strong><br /> This strand will investigate the current state of play across Europe. The research will concentrate on:<br /> •	The range and type of digitised material,<br /> •	Major digitisation programmes and projects,<br /> •	The services and organisations available to curate and manage this material,<br /> •	The range of advice and guidance available for content owners, digitisers and researchers, and<br /> •	Services to ensure interoperability and joining together of the infrastructure’s content. </p> <p><strong>2) Scope user requirements:</strong><br /> This strand will identify the stakeholder groups with an interest in DARIAH and work with them to identify a set of user requirements and their potential contribution to DARIAH. Stakeholder groups include both data users and data providers.</p> <p><strong>3) Identify key business drivers and benefits:</strong><br /> This strand will analyse the current status and activities in the EU and the user requirements to identify the key business drivers and benefits of DARIAH. The results will feed directly into the strategic vision of DARIAH and will be used for dissemination and financial work.</p> <p><strong>4) Define goals and objectives:</strong><br /> DARIAH’s goals will be developed, and the objectives that will enable DARIAH to achieve these goals and satisfy the business drivers.</p> <p><strong>5) Functional specifications:</strong><br /> The current status and activities in the EU and the user requirements will be analysed to scope the functional specifications for DARIAH’s activities and services. </p> <p><strong>6) Develop a Set of Policies for the Operation of DARIAH:</strong><br /> Policies will be developed for:<br /> •	Digitisation,<br /> •	Collection development and management,<br /> •	Preservation and<br /> •	Compliance as a trusted digital respository.<br /> These policies will specify the standards and best practice guidelines that DARIAH partners will be required to follow.</p> </div>
